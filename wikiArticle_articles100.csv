1,"The parbelos is a figure similar to the arbelos but instead of three half circles it uses three parabola segments. More precisely the parbelos consists of three parabola segments, that have a height that is one fourth of the width at their bases. The two smaller parabola segments are placed next to each other with their bases on a common line and the largest parabola is placed over the two smaller ones such that its width is the sum of the widths of the smaller ones (see graphic).
The parbelos has a number of properties which are somewhat similar or even identical to the some of the properties of the Arbelos. For instance the following two properties are identical to those of the arbelos:
The arc length of the outer parabola is equal to the sum of the arc lengths of the inner parabolas.
In a nested arbelos construction with the inner parabola segments being arbeloses themselves the two innermost parabola segments being adjacent to the cusp of the outer arbelos are congruent, that is of equal size.The quadrilateral

2,"Punch-Out!! is an arcade boxing video game by Nintendo, developed in 1983 and released in February 1984. It was the first in a series of successful Punch-Out!! games.
The arcade game was a global commercial success, becoming the top-performing arcade game of 1984 in the United States. It produced an arcade sequel known as Super Punch-Out!!, a spin-off of the series titled Arm Wrestling, a highly popular version for the NES originally known as Mike Tyson's Punch Out!!, and Super Punch-Out!! for the SNES.
The arcade game introduced recurring video games characters such as Glass Joe, Piston Hurricane, Bald Bull, and Mr. Sandman. It was also the debut project at Nintendo for composer Koji Kondo, better known for his later contributions in the Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda series.


== Gameplay ==

In the game, the player takes the role of a green-haired unnamed boxer (sometimes claimed to be Little Mac from the NES versions), known by three initials the player chooses when the game begins. During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind and above as a wireframe so the opponent can be seen. The player must time his punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer. Opponents' impending offensive moves are telegraphed by subtle eye changes (the whites of the eyes flash yellow), but the player must ultimately predict what moves the opponent will make and react appropriately.
Once the player defeats the last opponent, the opponents repeat with increased difficulty. The player has one 3-minute round to score a knockout and will automatically lose if time runs out. A fighter who is knocked down three times in one round will be unable to rise, leading to a knockout. In the event the player loses, the computer-controlled victor will taunt the player and the corner man for the player will try to entice the player to play again (""Come on, stand up and fight!"") via the game's distinctive digitized speech. Players are only allowed one continue per play through. Like many games made during the Golden Age of Arcade Games, there is no actual ending and the game continuously loops until the player loses.

The game is a modified upright, and was unusual in that it requires two video monitors, one atop the other, for the game's display. The top monitor is used to display statistics and fighter portraits, while the bottom one is the main game display (similar to Nintendo's Multi-Screen Game & Watch titles and the Nintendo DS) with the gameplay and power meters (representing stamina) for each fighter. Apart from this, the game is more or a less a standard upright. The game has a joystick and three buttons. Two buttons control left and right punches, one for each arm (denoted by ""Left!"", or ""Right!"" when hitting the head, or ""body blow!"" when hitting the body with either arm). A large button on the console allows the player to deliver a powerful uppercut or right hook, but only when the ""KO"" meter on the display is completely full. The meter increases when the player successfully lands a punch, decreases when the opponent lands one, and drops to zero when the player is knocked down. Once the meter is full, the corner man's digitized speech encourages the player to either ""Put him away!"" or ""Knock him out!"" 


== Development and release ==

The game was developed in 1983, and released in February 1984. Genyo Takeda from the Integrated Research & Development Division was the lead developer, and Shigeru Miyamoto designed the characters. It was released in the first quarter of 1984, when Nintendo was making several coin-operated arcade machines. Nintendo had an excessive number of video monitors after the success of the Donkey Kong series, basing the purchases on the estimate for the demand for arcade games. They were offered a proposition to make an arcade game that used two monitors. They chose to make a boxing game, which utilized the ability to zoom in and out of an object. This was a feature more commonly found in games that involve flying such as flight simulators, but the developers chose boxing because they thought it would be a different way to use it.Miyamoto and Takeda discussed an earlier arcade game created by Takeda: EVR RACE, a horse racing game from 1975, which used a video tape. It was a mechanical game, and was hard to maintain after it was released and had many breakdowns. While they were developing Punch-Out!!, laserdisc-based games were considered to be the next major advancement in the arcade industry. However, the maintenance requirement would be very large if they released laserdisc-based games worldwide. Despite this, domestic sales people wanted something like laserdisc, so they tried to find if it could be done with semiconductors. Miyamoto explained that that's why they were interested in microchips that could perform zooming and show pictures at a similar size as a laserdisc. However, he called it a ""rascal of a project"", explaining that when he made Donkey Kong, he had to animate each rolling barrel pixel by pixel. When he asked if they could use processing on the hardware side to rotate the image, they said ""it's not impossible"", changing from ""it can't be done.""He stated that a lot of new things were being created, but most of it was still under development. They told Miyamoto that they could zoom in or rotate the image, but not both at once. They were planning on using the new microchips as well as the two monitors, considering lining them up side by side and making a big racing game, but it was not powerful enough to accomplish this, only able to expand one of the images. Takeda stated that if they could only expand one image, it could be a person. This eventually allowed it to become a boxing game, with one opponent, deciding that one monitor was good enough for a boxing game. They were stuck at that point, but thought that a boxing arena has big lights and banners hanging from the ceiling with things like ""World Heavyweight Title Match"" written on them. The game would also feature several meters, so they thought it would be more fun to have two screens instead of one.Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, and Donkey Kong Junior all appear in the audience. The game's title music, also heard in the arcade version of Super Punch-Out!! and the NES version of Punch-Out!!, is actually the ""Gillette Look Sharp March"". This jingle, originally heard in Gillette radio and television commercials in the 1950s, was later used as the theme song to the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports, which aired boxing matches.


== Reception ==
The arcade game was a hit in all regions for Nintendo. In Japan, Game Machine listed Punch-Out!! on their April 15, 1984 issue as being the second top-grossing upright/cockpit arcade cabinet of the month.In North America, Punch-Out took the arcade market by storm according to Play Meter magazine in 1984, capitalizing on the success of sports video games following Track & Field (1983). It was one of the more successful arcade games during the post-boom period of the mid-1980s. Punch-Out topped the US arcade charts during 1984, including the RePlay charts in July (upright cabinets) and December, and the Play Meter charts for dedicated arcade cabinets from August 1 through November 15. Punch-Out went on to become the top-performing arcade game of 1984 in the United States.The arcade game was reviewed in the August 1984 issue of Computer and Video Games, published in July 1984. The magazine gave the game a positive review, describing it as a ""knock-out"" and a ""fabulous boxing game"". The review also praised the graphics as being ""great"" and ""cartoon-style"" and concluded that it is ""a very addictive game which is great fun to play.""Punch-Out!! was later marked in the Killer List of Videogames (KLOV) Top 100, as one of their top 100 best games of all time. They also listed it as the Game of the Year for the year 1984. In 1995, Flux magazine rated Punch-Out!! 21st in its ""Top 100 Video Games."" In 1996, GamesMaster ranked the game 83rd on their ""Top 100 Games of All Time.""


== Legacy ==
In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, series protagonist Little Mac appears as a playable fighter. The character features a set of wireframe alternate costumes based on his appearance from the original arcade games. Little Mac also features a special mechanic based on the KO gauge from the arcade titles, which, once full, can usually let him instantly KO an opponent with a powerful uppercut.


=== Re-releases, sequels, and spin-offs ===
During the same year, an arcade sequel to Punch-Out!! titled Super Punch-Out!! was developed and released by Nintendo, which has fewer, but tougher boxers to fight against.
In 1985, a spin-off called Arm Wrestling was developed and released in the arcades only in North America by the same company, which is based on real arm wrestling.
In 1987, the growing popularity of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) caused the development and release of Punch-Out!! for the NES console to happen. Several elements, such as opponents and their names, were changed for this version. In particular, professional boxer Mike Tyson was added as the game's final boss. In 1990, when the contract licensing the use of Tyson's name in the console version expired, Nintendo replaced Tyson with an original character named Mr. Dream, re-releasing it as Punch-Out!! (or Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream). Like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream bore no further resemblance to the arcade version.
During its release, the Game & Watch game called Boxing was re-released as Punch-Out!!, which used the front box art of the Mr. Dream version as its package art. Sometimes it was released with different cover art.
A Super Nintendo Entertainment System title, Super Punch-Out!! was released in 1994. It was far more faithful to the arcade stand-up gameplay; however, it was not a direct port either.
A Wii title, Punch-Out!! was released in 2009. It is a reboot of the Punch-Out!! series, that brought back many characters from the previous games, as well as introducing Disco Kid and Donkey Kong as opponents.
On September 13, 2017, Nintendo announced during a Nintendo Direct that they would be re-releasing some of their classic arcade games on the Nintendo Switch, and that Punch-Out!! would be one of the several games that would be re-released. It was released on March 30, 2018.

15,"Roasso Kumamoto (ロアッソ熊本, Roasso Kumamoto) is a Japanese football club based in Kumamoto, the capital city of Kumamoto Prefecture. The club currently plays in the J2 League,  which is the second tier of football in the country. Roasso is a portmanteau of the Italian words rosso and asso, meaning ""red ace"".


== History ==


=== Early years (1969–2004) ===
The club was founded as the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation (Den-Den Kōsha, current NTT) Kumamoto Soccer Club in 1969. The club was promoted to the Kyushu Soccer League in 1983.
According to the NTT's privatization in 1985, the club was renamed as NTT Kyushu Soccer Club in 1988. During the NTT Kyushu era, the club won five Kyushu Soccer League titles and one All Japan Senior Football Championship. The club changed their name again to NTT Kumamoto Football Club in 2000.
The club changed their name to NTT West Kumamoto Football Club in 2001 as the NTT was divided into NTT East and NTT West. The club was promoted to the JFL in 2001. The NTT relinquished the ownership of the club in 2002 and community-oriented Alouette Kumamoto Football Club was born. Alouette is a French word meaning skylark, the bird of Kumamoto Prefecture. The club finished at the 17th in this season and was relegated to the Kyushu Soccer League.


=== Roasso Kumamoto (2005–) ===
The club name changed again to Rosso Kumamoto in 2005. Rosso means red in Italian. After they won the Kyushu Soccer League and finished at the 3rd in the Regional League play-off tournament, the club was promoted to the JFL.
The club was recently featured in J.League programming to introduce the club to followers of the pro league. Rosso's second-place finish in the 2007 JFL season was high enough to earn promotion into the J.League (J2 League) for the 2008 season.
The club changed their name to current Roasso Kumamoto in 2008. The previous name Rosso was a registered trademark of another company and the club could not use it.


== Rivalries ==
The traditional rival of Roasso Kumamoto is Kagoshima United, the prefectural neighbors and former Kyushu Soccer League fellows since 1983 until 2005, except 2001–2002. Matches between the two clubs are labelled Hisatsu derby (肥薩ダービー, ""Kumamoto-Kagoshima derby"") and generate a lot of interest in both prefectures.

It is a Level III ecoregion in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) classification system, where it is designated as ecoregion number 50. The ecoregion is characterized by coniferous and northern hardwoods forests, morainal hills, large lake basins, and broad areas of sandy outwash plains, with numerous lakes and wetlands. The Northern Lakes and Forests are less well-suited to agriculture than ecoregions to the south, owing to shorter growing seasons, lower temperatures, and soils formed mainly from nutrient-poor sandy and loamy glacial drift material.

The Municipal Campaign Finance Code also known as the Jeffersonville Ethics Ordinance is what the Jeffersonville Ethics Commission use to enforce political campaigns. It is ordinance 2006-OR-36 in the city records and contains eighteen pages and seven articles.

Article VI - Miscellaneous Provisions which covers severability. Article VII - Effective Date.


=== Amended version ===
The Municipal Campaign Finance Code would become amended with an ordinance numbering 2007-OR-56 in city records. In this amendment to the Municipal Campaign Finance Code it begins with an introduction, Article I definitions, and then into Article II Section 2.4 Receiving and Collecting Gifts and Favors.

The amendment then continues with political activity regulating officials, candidates, or employees interactions with other officials or employees political interests. As well as the limitations thus far the amendment addresses a Whistleblower Protection clause for people making reports with the Ethics Commission as long as they aren't knowingly making a false report.

Member: Jim Berryman
Member: Bruce Barkhauer 
Member: Ron Glass

24,"Jack Calmes (October 21, 1943 – January 5, 2015) was an American inventor, executive and musician.
In 1965, he co-founded Showco, a concert sound and lighting service company. In 1984, Calmes founded Syncrolite, an entertainment/architectural light manufacturer.Calmes received two United States patents, managed Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Freddie King and multi-platinum rock band Bloodrock, and founded the Forever Fabulous Chickenhawks Showband & All-Revue.


== Early life ==
Calmes was born in Oklahoma City to parents Mary and Charles Calmes. Calmes picked up a love of music from his mother, Mary, who was a piano player and singer. The family relocated to Clinton, Oklahoma, not long after he was born.
Calmes' lifelong fascination with music first showed itself when playing Eddy Arnold songs on the ukulele, before learning guitar at the age of 15. The Calmes family had moved to Dallas' Highland Park neighborhood when he was nine, and he was soon performing professionally at the Dallas Sportatorium.
Calmes attended Highland Park High School, where as a sophomore, he formed his first band, the Jades, in direct competition with classmates Steve Miller and Boz Scaggs. In 1961, Calmes, Miller and Scaggs joined forces to merge their two bands, and, according to Calmes, ""played all the proms and got more money.""Miller and Scaggs attended out-of-state colleges after high school graduation, and Calmes remained in Dallas, continuing to perform locally as he attended Southern Methodist University, beginning in 1962. He laid the foundation for his future achievements in technology and business, studying engineering for two years before shifting his focus to the business school, graduating with a bachelor's degree in accounting.


== Showco and Soul City ==
In 1966, after Calmes graduated from Southern Methodist University, he teamed up with fellow Dallas resident Angus Wynne, later joined by Jack Maxson and Rusty Brutsche, to create the music-related company Showco.Among Showco's early coups: a Texas-University of Oklahoma party at Dallas' Market Hall featuring Chuck Berry as the headliner; promoting other concerts by such stars as Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin and the Doors, and a double bill of Ike and Tina Turner and the Righteous Brothers at a Dallas country club that Calmes cited as ""the biggest one.""In 1967, Calmes and Wynne expanded their business portfolio by opening a nightclub, Soul City, on Greenville Avenue in Dallas. During the short time they owned the 300-capacity space, it featured shows by Stevie Wonder, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Ike and Tina Turner and Jerry Lee Lewis. Calmes would often join the headliners, performing on stage during their sets. Calmes and Wynne sold their interest in Soul City in 1968.During their tenure at Soul City, the partners used their Showco sound system, impressing the hundreds of bands who performed at the club. The Showco team was also responsible for booking the Texas International Pop Festival in 1969. Although the festival was a success, Calmes and Wynne couldn't sustain the financial burden of producing it, reportedly over $100,000 ($739,000 today), and parted ways. Calmes would regroup and rededicate his efforts to building up Showco.Showco's initial focus was sound systems, addressing musicians' frustrations with sub-par live sound set-ups. As a gigging musician himself, Calmes understood the need for clear, efficient sound systems, and worked to provide them for a range of clients‘ live shows and tours, starting with Three Dog Night, Led Zeppelin and Steppenwolf as the company’s first three accounts, later ranging from Elvis Presley to Genesis. At its peak, Showco had ten sets of lighting and sound packages traveling with major acts. Other bands utilizing Showco's touring packages included the Carpenters, Bread, Rare Earth and the Kinks.As a technology company, Showco built its own soundboards, developing automated lights that could change colors, and entire systems controllable from one master switchboard. They were the first to use lasers in a concert, to use trusses, they invented aluminum towers and pneumatic towers, allowing shows to be set up quickly. The business grew to include product marketing as well.Calmes resigned as president of Showco in 1980. What began as Showco was later spun off into Vari*Lite, so named in 1984.


== Syncrolite ==
After resigning from Showco, Calmes founded the Dallas-based Syncrolite, in 1984. The company's achievements include developing the first, fully automated DMX (digital multiplex)-controlled Xenon light system in 1989.
That system, however, resulted in a 1989 lawsuit from Vari*Lite, claiming Calmes infringed upon Vari*Lite's patents for moving concert lights that could change color. Calmes countersued Vari*Lite, claiming his former business partners had misled him about the development of the Vari-Lite system when he left Showco in 1980. He felt that he had inadvertently mimicked, though also exceeded, the Vari*Lite system. After five years, the case was resolved in favor of Vari*Lite.Syncrolite continued operations, and has provided systems for an array of events, including events such as the 2012 Olympics in London; the 75th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge; Super Bowl XLV and the 2014 NCAA Final Four at AT&T Stadium; the three-day March Madness Music Festival at Reunion Park in downtown Dallas; the Houston Rodeo; the 30th anniversary of Wrestlemania at the New Orleans Superdome and a Red Bull ""Crashed Ice"" event in Quebec City.


== Other endeavors ==
Through a division of Showco, Calmes began managing musical artists in 1970. Among the acts he was responsible for included Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Freddie King (whom Calmes got signed to Leon Russell's Shelter Records); Bloodrock and John Nitzinger, as well as Jim Rutledge, amassing what he says are ""seven or eight gold records.""Calmes also produced a variety of film and live television projects, including a global satellite broadcast of the Who in 1982 (later released as the documentary The Who Rocks America) for 20th Century Fox and HBO, as well as the 1988 presidential debates for CSN. Calmes also co-produced the 1978 Rolling Stones concert film Some Girls: Live in Texas '78.In 1980, Calmes founded the 16-piece soul-blues-R&B group Forever Fabulous Chickenhawks Showband & All-Star Revue, in which he played lead guitar. The Chickenhawks released five albums, including three live albums (1999's Live, 2002's Live from the Gypsy Tea Room and 2007's Louisiana Live) and two studio albums (1999's Chickenhawks and 2004's Deep in the Heart).


== Patents ==
Calmes earned two United States patents (numbers 8,596,824  and 8,721,123) for a ""method and apparatus for a scrollable modifier for a light fixture"" and a ""pattern generator for a light fixture,"" respectively.
The patents were both filed by Calmes as a representative of Syncrolite and granted in 2009. The patents he held as part of Showco were sold when he left the company, as part of the corporation's intellectual property, although Calmes did keep a percentage of the patent.
The abstract for the ""pattern generator for a light fixture"" reads: 

An apparatus includes a first flexible material that has a first area with a first texture that produces a first predetermined amount of diffusion of a beam of light, where the first texture produces at least some diffusion in the beam of light. The apparatus also includes a second flexible material attached to a first portion of the first area, where the second flexible material reduces the amount of diffusion of the beam of light produced by the first texture of the first portion of the first area. A light fixture includes a light fixture and the first flexible material coupled to a scrolling mechanism. The scrolling mechanism is operable to position a selected area of the first flexible material such that a beam of light from the light source passes through a first area of the first flexible material.

The abstract for the ""method and apparatus for a scrollable modifier for a light fixture"" reads: 
A light fixture includes a light source, a first flexible material coupled to a first scrolling mechanism, and a second flexible material coupled to a second scrolling mechanism. The first flexible material includes a first pattern generator and the first scrolling mechanism is operable to move the first pattern generator from a first position to a second position in a beam of light from the light source. The second flexible material includes a second pattern generator and the second scrolling mechanism is operable to move the second pattern generator to a third position in the beam of light. A changing pattern is produced in the beam of light.

26,"Liga 1 (English: League One), also known as BRI Liga 1 for sponsorship reasons with Bank Rakyat Indonesia, is the men's top professional football division of the Indonesian football league system. Administered by the PT Liga Indonesia Baru (English: New Indonesian League, LLC), Liga 1 is contested by 18 clubs and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with Liga 2.
Top-flight professional league in Indonesia started from the 2008–09 season onwards, initially under the name of Indonesia Super League until 2015. Prior to the 2008 reforms, the national competitions used a tournament format. Liga 1, which started in 2017, is the latest rebranding of the league.Forty teams have competed in the top-tier league of Indonesian football since the start of the modern era in 2008 as the Indonesia Super League. Seven teams have been crowned champions, with Persipura Jayapura winning the title three times (2009, 2011, 2013), the most among the teams.


== History ==


=== Origins ===
In 1994, PSSI merged teams from Perserikatan, which was a popular league for amateur clubs representing regional football associations, and Galatama, which was a less popular league made up of semi-professional teams, to form Liga Indonesia, integrating the fanaticism in the Perserikatan and the professionalism of Galatama with the aim of improving the quality of Indonesian football. This effort ushered in a tiered system in the Indonesian competitive football scene. The group stage format, which was used in Perserikatan, was combined with a full competition system followed by the semi-final and final rounds like Galatama.


=== Foundation ===
The modern competition era started in 2008 with the 2008–09 Indonesia Super League. The first season began with 18 clubs. The first Indonesia Super League goal was scored by Ernest Jeremiah of Persipura in a 2–2 draw against Sriwijaya F.C. The 18 inaugural members of the new Indonesia Super League were Persipura, Persiwa, Persib, Persik, Sriwijaya, Persela, Persija, PSM, Pelita Jaya, Arema, Persijap, Persiba, PKT Bontang, Persitara, PSMS, Deltras, Persita, and PSIS. Originally, Persiter and Persmin were qualified to register but they failed the verification requirements to be inaugural members of the Indonesia Super League.


=== Dualism ===

As the football scene in Indonesia was heavily politicized with rival factions upending each other, conflict was the norm prior to 2017. The worst conflict occurred in 2011. After the inauguration of the new PSSI board in 2011, a member of PSSI's Executive Committee and chairman of its Competition Committee, Sihar Sitorus, appointed PT Liga Prima Indonesia Sportindo as the new league operator replacing PT Liga Indonesia because the latter failed to provide an accountability report to the PSSI. Sitorus, one of many politicians in the PSSI, announced the Indonesia Premier League as the new top-level competition in Indonesia. Upon the emergence of Liga Primer Indonesia (LPI), PSSI did not recognize the validity of ISL. ISL regulars PSM, Persema, and Persibo, which had boycotted the ISL operators due to referee and management decisions, gladly defected to join LPI along with splinters of existing ISL teams. However, the 2011 LPI season was stopped mid-season, due to continued schism within PSSI; a new league, Indonesian Premier League (Liga Prima Indonesia, IPL) replaced it in late 2011 for the 2011–12 season.Before the schism of PSSI, Sitorus triggered more controversy when he said the new competition would be divided into two regions and there would be an addition of six clubs in the top division, which angered many association members. Thus, 14 teams that were supposed to be Indonesia Premier League contestants chose to support the Indonesia Super League that continued to roll under the support of the pro-IPL faction, despite being labeled as an illegal competition. The official PSSI, supported by FIFA and AFC, did not recognize the ISL for two seasons. In the meantime, the Indonesian Premier League became the top-tier league from 2011 to 2013 with 17 teams.In a PSSI extraordinary meeting on 17 March 2013, association members slammed Sitorus and decided that the Indonesia Super League would once again emerge as the top-level competition, following the disbandment of the Indonesian Premier League. Sitorus and five other PSSI board members were suspended from the sport for their roles in the split (locally referred to as dualisme, ""dualism"" in English) that disrupted Indonesian football.The new PSSI board also decided that the best seven teams of the 2013 Indonesian Premier League, following verification, would join the unified league. Semen Padang, Persiba Bantul, Persijap, and PSM passed verification, while Perseman, Persepar, and Pro Duta did not, meaning the 2014 season was contested with 22 teams.


=== Government intervention and FIFA suspension ===

The impact of split haunted Indonesian football years after the reconsolidation. On 18 April 2015, Minister of Youth and Sports Affairs Imam Nahrawi officially banned the activities of PSSI after PSSI refused to recognize the recommendations from the Indonesian Professional Sports Agency (BOPI), an agency under the ministry, that Arema Cronus and Persebaya should not pass ISL verification because there were still other clubs using the same name. Previously, Nachrawi had sent three letters of reprimand. However, PSSI refused to answer his call until a predetermined deadline. As a result, PSSI officially stopped all competitions in 2015 season after PSSI's Executive Committee meeting on 2 May 2015 called the government intervention as a force majeure.The government intervention also led FIFA to punish Indonesia with a one-year suspension of all association football activities as the world body considered overbearing state involvement in footballing matters as a violation against its member PSSI. During the suspension, some tournaments were made to fill the vacuum, starting with the 2015 Indonesia President's Cup, in which Persib came out as champions, until the Bhayangkara Cup closed the series of unrecognized tournaments.On 13 May 2016, FIFA officially ended the suspension, following the revocation of the Indonesian ministerial decision on 10 May 2016. A long-term tournament with full competition format, Indonesia Soccer Championship, emerged shortly thereafter. The 2016 season saw Persipura taking the title.


=== Current name ===
In 2017, the top-flight football competition was rebranded under a new official name, Liga 1. The name changes also applied to Premier Division (became Liga 2) and Liga Nusantara (became Liga 3). The operator of the competition was also changed from PT Liga Indonesia (LI) to PT Liga Indonesia Baru (LIB). Bhayangkara was the first champion of the competition under the new name. True to the controversial nature of Indonesian football, the crowning triggered flak from fans. Bhayangkara, a team managed by the Indonesian Police that had no fanbase, won the title due to head-to-head advantage against Bali United, a team with rapidly growing support due to its modern professional management, after both teams had the same points at the end of the season. Bali United finally won the title in 2019.


== Competition format ==


=== Competition ===
There are 18 clubs in Liga 1. During the course of a season all teams play each other twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents', for 34 games. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points first, then head-to-head records, goal difference, goals scored, fair play, and drawing of lots. The three lowest placed teams are relegated into Liga 2, and the second round group winners from Liga 2, together with the winner of third place play-off involving the group runner-up of Liga 2 second round, are promoted in their place.


=== Promotion and relegation ===
A system of promotion and relegation exists between Liga 1 and Liga 2. The three lowest placed teams in Liga 1 are relegated to Liga 2, and the second round group winners from Liga 2 are promoted to the Liga 1, with an additional team promoted after a third-place play-off involving the group runners-up of Liga 2 second round. The Indonesian Super League had 22 teams in 2014 due to the merging of the two professional leagues in Indonesia.


== Clubs ==

Forty clubs have played in the top-flight Indonesian football competitions from the start of the modern era in 2008 as Indonesia Super League, up to and including the 2022–23 season.


=== Champions ===


=== Most successful clubs ===

27,"The 1969 Buffalo Bills season was the team’s tenth season, and was the final season of the American Football League before the 1970 AFL-NFL Merger. The Bills played an AFL-record seven games against opponents that went on to reach the postseason; Buffalo lost all seven of these games.
This was the rookie season for running back O. J. Simpson, the Heisman Trophy winner from Southern California and first overall selection in the draft, who went on to a Hall of Fame career.
Although Buffalo only won four games, their penultimate win—a Week Ten victory against the Miami Dolphins—would be their last victory against the Dolphins until the 1980 season. After the win, the Bills suffered against Miami an NFL-record twenty consecutive games lost by one team to another.

29,"""Please Make Up Your Mind"" (aka ""Why Don't You Make Up Your Mind?"") is a song written and recorded by Hank Williams and released as a ""Luke the Drifter"" single in 1952.


== Background ==
Little Jimmy Dickens had been the first to release ""Please Make Up Your Mind"" to the Canadian market under the title ""I Wish You Didn't Love Me So Much,"" but Dickens' version was up-tempo and included a line not found in Williams' version:

The preacher man said, ""For better or worse""
But lately I've been lookin' for that big black hearseWilliams version, however, has a different feel altogether and was almost certainly aimed at his former wife Audrey Williams, whom he had legally divorced the day before the recording session.  Country music historian Colin Escott calls it the most ""rivetingly vengeful"" song the singer ever recorded:

""Over a slow blues backing and with bleak humor, Hank catalogued his grievances against Audrey:  her tantrums, her attempts to belittle him, her ungovernable temper...Not until Bob Dylan's 'Positively 4th Street' was there a song so bitter and demeaning.""According to Escott, the original draft contained the lines, ""Whoever said women was the weaker sex/ Baby never had you on his neck,"" but, like lines in the Dickens version, were cut, with producer Fred Rose possibly deeming them too dark for commercial release.  The song's blunt subject matter and spoken vocal ensured it to be released as a ""Luke the Drifter"" recording, the pseudonym for Hank's atypical releases that let jukebox operators know they were not danceable, honky tonk records.  It was recorded at Castle Studio in Nashville with Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Don Helms (steel guitar), and Harold Bradley (rhythm guitar), while it is speculated that Chet Atkins played lead guitar and Ernie Newton played bass. The track also appeared on the 1953 LP Hank Williams as Luke the Drifter.  This recording session, held on July 11, 1952, was Hank's next-to-last and also produced the single's B-side ""Be Careful of Stones that You Throw"" as well as ""You Win Again.""

32,"A macular hole is a small break in the macula, located in the center of the eye's light-sensitive tissue called the retina.


== Symptoms ==
If the vitreous is firmly attached to the retina when it pulls away, it can tear the retina and create a macular hole.  Also, once the vitreous has pulled away from the surface of the retina, some of the fibers can remain on the retinal surface and can contract.  This increases tension on the retina and can lead to a macular hole.  In either case, the fluid that has replaced the shrunken vitreous can then seep through the hole onto the macula, blurring and distorting central vision.


== Causes ==
The eye contains a jelly-like substance called the vitreous.  Shrinking of the vitreous usually causes the hole.  As a person ages, the vitreous becomes watery  and begins to pull away from the retina.  If the vitreous is firmly attached to the retina when it pulls away, a hole can result.


== Diagnosis ==

Macular degeneration is a condition affecting the tissues lying under the retina, while a macular hole involves damage from within the eye, at the junction between the vitreous and the retina itself.  There is no relationship between the two diseases.  Depending upon the degree of attachment or traction between the vitreous and the retina, there may be risk of developing a macular hole in the other eye. In those cases where the vitreous has already become separated from the retinal surface, there is very little chance of developing a macular hole in the other eye.  On the other hand, when the vitreous remains adherent and pulling on the macular region in both eyes, then there may be a greater risk of developing a hole in the second eye.  In very rare instances, trauma or other conditions lead to the development of a macular hole.  In the vast majority of cases, however, macular holes develop spontaneously.  As a result, there is no known way to prevent their development through any nutritional or chemical means, nor is there any way to know who is at risk for developing a hole prior to its appearance in one or both eyes.


== Management ==
Vitrectomy is the common way to treat a macular hole. It is done by placing a gas bubble in the vitreous of the eye which helps flatten the macular hole and holds it in place as the eye heals. The gas bubble slowly shrinks on its own. Treatment is also done using ocriplasmin.

35,"Tun Haji Abdul Razak bin Dato' Hussein (Jawi: عبدالرزاق بن حسين; 11 March 1922 – 14 January 1976) was a Malaysian politician who served as the second prime minister of Malaysia from September 1970 until his death in January 1976. He also served as the first deputy prime minister of Malaysia from August 1957 to September 1970. He is referred to as the Father of Development (Bapa Pembangunan).
Abdul Razak was the figure responsible for setting up Barisan Nasional (BN), which is the ruling coalition of political parties that held power in Malaysia. Abdul Razak is also renowned for launching the Malaysian New Economic Policy (MNEP).
His eldest son, Najib Razak, became the sixth prime minister in 2009; Najib is the first prime minister of Malaysia to be a descendant of a former prime minister.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Kampung Pulau Keladi, a village located northwest of Pekan, Pahang on 11 March 1922, Abdul Razak is the first of two children to Yang DiHormat Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar ke-9, Dato' Hussein bin Mohd Taib and Datin Hajah Teh Fatimah bt Daud. An aristocratic descendant of Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar, Abdul Razak studied at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar.
After joining the Malay Administrative Service in 1939, he was awarded a scholarship to study at Raffles College in Singapore in 1940. His studies at the college ceased with the onset of the Second World War. During the war he helped organise the Wataniah resistance movement in Pahang.After World War II, Abdul Razak left for Britain in 1947 to study law. In 1950 he received a law degree and qualified as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. During his student days in England,  Abdul Razak was a member of the British Labour Party and a prominent student leader of the Malay Association of Great Britain. He also formed the Malayan Forum.


== Involvements in World War II ==


=== Early WWII and Askar Wataniah ===
After his studies were interrupted in 1942 because of World War II, Abdul Razak returned to Kuantan, Pahang. There, he met his former colleague from the Malay Administrative Service, Yeop Mahidin, and expressed his interest in joining the Malay Regiment (now Royal Malay Regiment). Mahidin, who is also the founder of Askar Wataniah Pahang ('Pahang State Territorial Army'; precursor of Rejimen Askar Wataniah), recruited Razak into his new guerrilla forces. After finishing his training under Mahidin, Razak was instructed by him to join the Japanese Malayan Civil Service as an agent and informant.


=== Informant in Japanese Administration ===
After finishing his Japanese Military Training, Razak, as an aristocrat and son of a respected Malay leader in Pahang, was posted to his home-state Pahang as an assistant to District Officer and at the same time as a bridge for the Japanese to gain the trust of local Pahang Malays. Using his privileges as an aristocrat, Razak started networking with the Japanese Imperial Forces while maintaining his connection with Yeop Mahidin. His role as an informant inside the Japanese Administration was known only to a few of Wataniah members including Mahidin. Because of this, Razak was labelled as a traitor by the rest of the Wataniah Pahang.


=== Force 136 Pahang ===
At first, the Malays were not fully trusted by the British to fight the Japanese because of a few incidents and better treatment by the Japanese Administration towards Malays compared to other races. After gaining sufficient trust, the Askar Wataniah Pahang with its 200 members was absorbed into the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and made into to Force 136 Pahang.Force 136 Pahang's missions' continuous success made the Japanese Administration begin to suspect that there were informants inside their administration. Force 136 Pahang quickly set up an extraction mission to recover their agent, Razak, who was still unknown to many of its members.After he had been successfully extracted, Razak continued his work with Force 136 and was promoted to the rank of captain. Among notable missions, Razak was involved in the rescue of Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang from MPAJA.


== Political involvement ==

Upon his return from the United Kingdom, in 1950, Tun Razak joined the Malayan Civil Service. Owing to his political calibre, he became the youth chief for United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Two years later, he worked as the Assistant State Secretary of Pahang and in February 1955, at just 33 years of age, became Pahang's Chief Minister.
Razak stood in and won a seat in Malaya's first general elections in July 1955 and was appointed as the Education Minister. He was instrumental in the drafting of the Razak Report which formed the basis of the Malayan education system. Tun Razak was also a key member of the February 1956 mission to London to seek the independence of Malaya from the British.After the general elections in 1959, he became the Minister of Rural Development in addition to holding the portfolios of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, which he held from 1957. His achievements include formulating the development policy known as the Red Book.


== Infusing young blood ==
At the time of Separation of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, Tun Razak realised that UMNO needed more young leaders in the party. Faced with, amongst other things Lee Kuan Yew's considerable rhetorical skills, Razak wanted young Malay leaders – grounded in their own faith and culture – who would be able to speak and if necessary debate both in the Malay language and English language.
Razak understood that power resided in the Malay community and that for this power to be wielded effectively, the elite among the Malays had to be an elite determined by ability, aptitude and commitment to the nation as a whole. Class, birth and money were secondary in his calculations.
As a consequence of this initiative, the then young leaders of mixed heritage in UMNO, such as Mahathir Mohamad, were drafted into higher echelons of the political establishment.
In 1967 he was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for community leadership.


== Prime Ministership ==
After the 13 May Incident in 1969, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra received many criticisms from various parties for his inability to deal with racial issues. This led to his resignation as prime minister. Tun Abdul Razak then imposed a State of Emergency, ruling by decree as the National Operations Council until 1970. In September 1970, Tunku Abdul Rahman was succeeded by Tun Abdul Razak as the Prime Minister of Malaysia.
Tun Razak set up the Barisan Nasional or National Front on 1 January 1973 to replace the ruling Alliance Party. He increased the membership of its parties and coalitions in an effort to establish ""Ketahanan Nasional"" (National Strength) through political stability.
Tun Razak is also renowned for launching the Malaysian New Economic Policy (MNEP) in 1971. He and the ""second generation"" of Malay politicians saw the need to tackle vigorously the economic and social disparities which fuelled racial antagonisms and violence. The MNEP set two basics goals – to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty, and to reduce and eventually eradicate identification of economic function with race.

37,"In Taiwan, the White Terror (Chinese: 白色恐怖; pinyin: Báisè Kǒngbù) is used to describe the political repression on civilians living on the island and the surrounding areas under its control  by the government under the rule of the Kuomintang (KMT).  The period of White Terror is generally considered to have begun when martial law was declared in Taiwan on 19 May 1949, which were enabled by the 1948 Temporary Provisions against the Communist Rebellion, and ended on 21 September 1992 with the repeal of Article 100 of the Criminal Code, which allowed for the prosecution of people for ""anti-state"" activities; the Temporary Provisions were repealed a year earlier on 22 April 1991 and martial law was lifted on 15 July 1987.The period of White Terror generally does not include the 228 Incident of 1947, in which the KMT killed at least 18,000 Taiwanese civilians in response to a popular uprising and also summarily executed many local political and intellectual elites, though the two are frequently discussed in tandem as it was the catalyst which motivated the KMT to begin the White Terror.  Martial law was declared and lifted twice during the 228 Incident.
Following the 228 Incident, the KMT retreated from mainland China to Taiwan during the closing stages of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Wanting to consolidate its rule on its remaining territories, the KMT imposed harsh political suppression measures, which included enacting martial law, executing suspected leftists or those they suspected to be sympathetic toward the communists.  Others targeted included Taiwanese locals and indigenous peoples who participated in the 228 Incident, such as Uyongʉ Yata'uyungana, and those accused of dissidence for criticizing the government.The KMT carried out persecutions against those who criticized or opposed the government, accusing them of attempting to subvert the regime, while excessively expanding the scope of punishment throughout this period. It made use of the Taiwan Garrison Command (TGC), a secret police, as well as other intelligence units by enacting special criminal laws as tools for the government to purge dissidents. Basic human rights and the right to privacy were disregarded, with mass pervasive monitoring of the people, filings of sham criminal cases against anyone who were suspected as being a dissident, as well as labelling any individuals who were not conforming a pro-regime stance as being communist spies, often without merit.   It is estimated that about 3,000 to 4,000 civilians were executed by the government during White Terror. The government was also suspected of carrying out extrajudicial killings against exiles in other countries.Pro-democracy demonstrations attempted during this period, such as the Kaohsiung Incident, were harshly suppressed. The KMT ruled as a one-party state, with the existence of any other political parties strictly outlawed, resulting in non-existent competitive elections; unapproved tangwai candidates that won elections such as Hsu Hsin-liang would be spuriously impeached and often forced into exile. Even so, such restricted elections were marred by overt voter fraud, most notably during the Zhongli incident.
The ideology, theory and repression ruling pattern of Chiang Kai-shek's KMT's regime in mainland China and subsequently in Taiwan has been compared by some academics and scholars to fascist regimes elsewhere, such as Nazi Germany, with the National Revolutionary Army heavily dependent and inspired by the German military mission during the Sino-German cooperation (1926–1941) until Adolf Hitler decided to withdraw in 1938 to align with Imperial Japan. When Chiang retreated to Taiwan in 1949, his regime refused to establish a parliamentary democracy, but continued a variation of the fascist state in Taiwan. The legacy of authoritarianism and fascism during the White Terror in Taiwan has persisted until today, and political discussions about this topic continues to be highly controversial on the island.


== Time period ==

White Terror is generally considered to have begun with the declaration of martial law on 19 May 1949. For its ending date, some sources cite the lifting of martial law on 15 July 1987, while others cite the repeal of Article 100 of the Criminal Code on 21 September 1992, which allowed for the persecution of people for ""anti-state"" activities. Martial law officially lasted for almost four decades, which had been the longest period of martial law in the world at the time it was lifted. It is now the second longest, after Syria's 48-year period of martial law which lasted from 1963 to 2011.Most prosecutions took place between the first two decades as the KMT wanted to consolidate its rule on the island. Most of those prosecuted were labeled by the Kuomintang (KMT) as ""bandit spies"" (匪諜), meaning communist spies, and punished as such, often with execution. A Wang Jingwei quote, often misattributed to Chiang Kai-shek, once famously said that he would rather ""mistakenly kill 1,000 innocent people than allow one communist to escape"".The KMT mostly imprisoned Taiwan's intellectual and social elite out of fear that they might resist KMT rule or sympathize with communism. For example, the Formosan League for Reemancipation was a Taiwanese independence group established in 1947 which the KMT believed to be under communist control, leading to its members being arrested in 1950. The World United Formosans for Independence was persecuted for similar reasons. However, other prosecutions did not have such clear reasoning; in 1968 Bo Yang was imprisoned for his choice of words in translating a Popeye comic strip. A large number of the White Terror's other victims were mainland Chinese, many of whom owed their evacuation to Taiwan to the KMT.Many mainlander victims of White Terror, such as Bo Yang and Li Ao, moved on to promote Taiwan's democratization and the reform of the Kuomintang. In 1969, future president Lee Teng-hui was detained and interrogated for more than a week by the Taiwan Garrison Command, which demanded to know about his ""communist activities"" and told him ""killing you at this moment is as easy as crushing an ant to death."" Three years later he was invited to join the cabinet of Chiang Ching-kuo.Fear of discussing the White Terror and the February 28 Incident gradually decreased with the lifting of martial law after the 1987 Lieyu Massacre, culminating in the establishment of an official public memorial and an apology by President Lee Teng-hui in 1995. In 2008, President Ma Ying-jeou addressed a memorial service for the White Terror in Taipei. Ma apologized to the victims and their family members on behalf of the government and expressed the hope that Taiwan would never again experience a similar tragedy.


== Victims ==

Around 140,000 Taiwanese were imprisoned under harsh treatment during this period, with many either indirectly dying or suffering various health problems in the process. About 3,000 to 4,000 were directly executed for their real or perceived opposition to the KMT's Chiang Kai-shek government. Most of the victims of the White Terror were men, however, a number of women were tortured and/or executed.

== Legacy ==
Since the lifting of martial law in 1987, the government has set up the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation, a civilian reparations fund supported by public donations for the victims and their families. However, there was never a proper truth and reconciliation commission. Many descendants of victims remain unaware that their family members were victims, while many of the families of victims, especially from Mainland China, did not know the details of their relatives' mistreatment during the riot.

== History ==

Our Lady of the Rosary Parish was founded in 1927 by Bishop John Cantwell of Los Angeles.  The first pastor assigned to the parish was the Rev. Patrick Curran.  A rented house on Sierra Way initially served as a combination church and rectory.  Construction of the present church building began in May 1928.  It was completed in the Mission Revival architectural style in September of the same year.  The present rectory was built in 1936.  In addition to their parish responsibilities the parish priests also served as the chaplains of St. Bernardine, County and the State hospital in Patton, as well as the Native American Reservation at Del Rosa and Masses at Lake Arrowhead in the summer.Our Lady of the Rosary School was opened on January 6, 1947.  The Dominican Sisters from Houston, Texas served as the faculty.  The convent was built in 1950. The original school building was replaced with a new facility across the street from the old one.  The church building was enlarged and expanded in 1953.
On July 14, 1978 Pope Paul VI established the Diocese of San Bernardino.  Our Lady of the Rosary was named as the cathedral for the new diocese.

43,"The Hitachi Maru Incident (常陸丸事件, Hitachi-maru jiken) was a maritime incident which occurred during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, in which three Japanese transports were sunk in a Russian commerce raiding sortie by a Vladivostok-based armored cruiser squadron of the Imperial Russian Navy.


== Background ==
At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was blockaded within the confines of Port Arthur by the Imperial Japanese Navy.  However, the Russian subsidiary naval base at Vladivostok, although shelled by a Japanese squadron under the command of Vice Admiral Dewa Shigetō in March 1904, remained largely undamaged and unblockaded.  Located at Vladivostok was a garrison force consisting of the protected cruiser Bogatyr and auxiliary cruiser Lena and a stronger Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron consisting of the armored cruisers Russian cruiser Rossia, Rurik, and Gromoboi, under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen.This small squadron put to sea in the early months of the conflict for commerce raiding operations, and it was the concern of the Imperial Japanese Navy that it might be used either to attack targets on the Japanese mainland, or to coordinate an attack to lift the blockade on Port Arthur. The Japanese were forced to assign the IJN 2nd Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō with considerable resources in an attempt to locate and destroy it.


== Attack on Tsushima Strait ==
Russian Vice Admiral Petr Bezobrazov departed Vladivostok on 12 June 1904 with Rossia, Rurik, and Gromoboi under orders to proceed through the eastern Tsushima Channel in the Korean Strait, cruise for two days on known transport routes, and to then double back through the western channel, after which he was to attempt to join his forces to the fleet still blockaded at Port Arthur. On 15 June, he sighted two military transports, Hitachi Maru and Sado Maru en route to Dalny.Hitachi Maru was transporting 1,238 people, including 727 men of the 1st Reserve Regiment of the Imperial Guard of Japan and 359 men from the IJA 10th Division. Sado Maru was transporting 1,258 people, including 867 members of a railway engineering battalion. Both vessels were transporting a large amount of stores, most critically needed were eighteen Armstrong 11-inch (280 mm) siege howitzers, requested by the IJA 3rd Army to attack the Russian fortifications at Port Arthur.
Passing in the opposite direction was the smaller Izumi Maru, which was being used as an unarmed, but unmarked hospital ship transporting sick and wounded men from the front back to Japan.The only provision the Imperial Japanese Navy had made for protection of its transports was the protected cruiser Tsushima, which at this time (0715) was stationed approximately mid-channel. Tsushima sighted the Russian squadron in the heavy early morning fog, but was unable to raise a warning due to the short range of its wireless, and poor atmospheric conditions, and attempted to close the distance to Tsushima Island where conditions were better. She was sighted by the Russian squadron, but they did not pursue. Tsushima managed to transmit her warning at 0815 hours, and then headed back towards the Russian squadron. Admiral Kamimura, based at Takeshiki Guard District on Tsushima sent a warning to Shimonoseki to stop all sailing, then ordered his ships to pursue Tsushima.However, at 0900, the Russian squadron sighted Izumi Maru, and Bezobrazov sent Gromoboi to chase her. Gromoboi opened fire, killing or wounding over 30 men, before the Japanese transport stopped and surrendered. About 100 sick and wounded were taken off her, and then she was sunk west of Okinoshima, with those who refused to surrender still aboard. Around 1000, the Russian squadron sighted Sado Maru, and came into sight of the Japanese fleet at about the same time. Despite having just given the Japanese transport 40 minutes to surrender and abandon ship, Rurik fired two torpedoes into Sado Maru, which exploded, killing 239 passengers and crew, but which did not sink the ship. Sado Maru eventually drifted for the next 30 hours until she grounded on Okinoshima.Next, Gromoboi approached Hitachi Maru, which exhibited no sign of intending to surrender. Gromoboi opened fire with all guns, killing many of the men on deck, including her British captain and senior crewmen, and sinking the ship. Due to deteriorating visibility, the Japanese fleet could not close with the Russian squadron, and at 1330 reached the 152 survivors from Hitachi Maru.


== Aftermath ==

The Russian squadron continued  its operations against shipping on 16 June, when they seized the British steamer Allanton off Maizuru. The cruisers also sank two sailing boats the following day.The attack was a severe blow to Japanese public morale. Memorials were erected in Chidorigafuchi Park in Tokyo, and a mass grave commemorating the Imperial Guards was erected in Aoyama Cemetery. A monument to Sado Maru was built in Shiba Park (and was moved to Yasukuni Shrine in 1964). Kamimura received numerous death threats and came under extreme pressure to track down the Russian squadron, which he did at the Battle off Ulsan on 14 August 1904.

44,"Motupipi is a settlement in the Tasman District of New Zealand's upper South Island, located at the mouth of the Motupipi River east of Tākaka.
The name Motupipi translates as the island or bush (motu) with pipi shellfish, referring to the pipi which are found on the beach.


== History ==


=== European settlement ===
Europeans first surveyed the area in 1842 and began settling it in 1850. The settlement began as about 1500 acres of small dairy, fruit and hop farms.There are records of several notable early settlers:

Peter Packer and his parents were among the original settlers. He took over 150 acres in 1872, and was clearing, sowing and farming most of it by 1905.
Reuben Packard, who moved to the area with his parents a few years later, also took up 150 acres, which he cleared for sheep and beef farming.
Joseph Packard was born in Suffolk, England in 1826 and was the oldest early settler. He originally purchased a 50-acre block, before taking a 300-acre block which he used to graze a few cows and sheep and plant about 300 lemon trees.
Thomas Harwood, who was born at sea to parents from Yeovil in Somersetshire, England, purchased 235 acres of forested limestone land in 1868, which he began clearing and farming 1876. He initially farmed cattle, but transitioned by sheep farming in the early 20th century. By 1905, he had cleared and cultivated about 130 acres of the property. Harwood was also an active local politician.The Golden Bay Coal Company began mining for coal at Motupipi in the early 20th century.


== Education ==
Motupipi School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 6 students, with a roll of 67 as of July 2022.The school was established during the 1850s, making it one of the oldest schools in the Tasman District. By 1905, the school was a one-roomed building with a roll of 60 students and capacity for 10 more.

46,"Conne was a community in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada located on the Northern shore of Fortune Bay. It was first reported to be settled in 1836, in the first Census of Newfoundland with sixteen inhabitants. It was a severely isolated settlement, which had no church or school and very little land for growing crops, and it based its existence on the inshore fishery of cod, lobster, salmon and herring.


== History ==
Conne's first inhabitants were the family of Edward Hatch. Hatch's family lived in the area from about 1835, his descendants living on in the area for at least another 70 years. By the 1870s the Dodge Family had also moved into the community and stayed for at least 20 years, before leaving for an unknown reason. Other family names later included Barnes, Fudge, and GilesA small number of lobster factories operated between 1901 and 1921, and large amounts of salmon were reported to have been tinned in those years.

47,"The Canon PowerShot TX1 is a Canon digital camera. It was released on February 22, 2007 The TX1 is a hybrid device designed for both still imagery and video recording. It offers both HDTV (1280×720 pixel, 30 frame/s) movie capture, as well as 10× stabilized zoom and 7.1 megapixel sensor.  It is designed to improve upon hybrid offerings by competitors such as the Sony Cyber-shot M1, Sony Cyber-shot M2, and Pentax MX4. It is oriented vertically and uses the camcorder-like swivel LCD viewing screen.  Canon compares the hybrid camera's size to that of the Canon ELPH series of cameras.  The company distinguishes the camera for its optical image stabilizer technology, DIGIC III image processor, face detection technology and red-eye effect correction with a mention of its built-in lens cover and scratch-resistant, anti-reflective LCD screen.


== Reviews ==
On its release it was termed the most expensive ultra zoom (10–12×) camera on the market. It is relatively small (8.9 cm (3.5 in) × 6 cm (2.4 in) × 2.9 cm (1.1 in)) and as a hybrid camera it includes a combination of features that was a fairly revolutionary for digital photography at the time of release.  Although most digital cameras now offer both still image and video capabilities, few offer advanced levels of both such as ultra zoom and HDTV.  This was Canon's first attempt at such a hybrid.  The combination has not been highly regarded by reviewers and editors, but users were highly satisfied with the combination. Due to its weak sales, there was no successor model.

52,"The Symphonic Etudes (French: Études Symphoniques), Op. 13, is a set of études for solo piano by Robert Schumann.  It began in 1834 as a theme and sixteen variations on a theme by Baron von Fricken, plus a further variation on an entirely different theme by Heinrich Marschner.


== Composition ==
The first edition in 1837 carried an annotation that the tune was ""the composition of an amateur"": this referred to the origin of the theme, which had been sent to Schumann by Baron von Fricken, guardian of Ernestine von Fricken, the Estrella of his Carnaval Op. 9. The baron, an amateur musician, had used the melody in a Theme with Variations for flute. Schumann had been engaged to Ernestine in 1834, only to break abruptly with her the year after. An autobiographical element is thus interwoven in the genesis of the Études symphoniques (as in that of many other works of Schumann's).Of the sixteen variations Schumann composed on Fricken's theme, only eleven were published by him. (An early version, completed between 1834 and January 1835, contained twelve movements). The final, twelfth, published étude was a variation on the theme from the Romance Du stolzes England freue dich (Proud England, rejoice!), from Heinrich Marschner's opera Der Templer und die Jüdin, which was based on Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe (as a tribute to Schumann's English friend, William Sterndale Bennett).  The earlier Fricken theme occasionally appears briefly during this étude. The work was first published in 1837 as XII Études Symphoniques.  Only nine of the twelve études were specifically designated as variations. The sequence was as follows:

Theme – Andante [C♯ minor]
Etude I (Variation 1) – Un poco più vivo [C♯ minor]
Etude II (Variation 2) – Andante [C♯ minor]
Etude III – Vivace [E Major]
Etude IV (Variation 3) – Allegro marcato [C♯ minor]
Etude V (Variation 4) – Scherzando [C♯ minor]
Etude VI (Variation 5) – Agitato [C♯ minor]
Etude VII (Variation 6) – Allegro molto [E Major]
Etude VIII (Variation 7) – Sempre marcatissimo  [C♯ minor]
Etude IX – Presto possibile [C♯ minor]
Etude X (Variation 8) – Allegro con energia  [C♯ minor]
Etude XI (Variation 9) – Andante espressivo  [G♯ minor]
Etude XII (Finale) – Allegro brillante (based on Marschner's theme) [D♭ Major]Other titles had been considered in September 1834: Variations pathétiques and Etuden im Orchestercharakter von Florestan und Eusebius. In this latter case the Études would have been signed by two imaginary figures in whom Schumann personified two essential, opposite and complementary aspects of his own personality and his own poetic world. 'Florestan and Eusebius' then signed the Davidsbündlertänze, Op. 6; but only in the 1835 version of the Études symphoniques were the pieces divided so as to emphasize the alternation of more lyrical, melancholy and introvert pages (Eusebius) with those of a more excitable and dynamic nature (Florestan). In the 1837 version Florestan prevails.
Fifteen years later, in a second edition (Leipzig 1852), the 1837 title Études symphoniques became Études en forme de variations, two etudes (Nos. 3 and 9) that did not correspond to the new title (not being exactly variations) were eliminated, and some revisions were made in the piano writing.
The entire work was dedicated to Schumann's English friend, the pianist and composer William Sterndale Bennett.  Bennett played the piece frequently in England to great acclaim, but Schumann thought it was unsuitable for public performance and advised his wife Clara not to play it.


== Character ==
Leaving aside the allusions to Florestan and Eusebius, all of Schumann's proposed titles show some of the essential character of Op. 13's conception. This was of 'studies' in the sense that the term had assumed in Frédéric Chopin's Op. 10, that is to say, concert pieces in which the investigation of possibilities of technique and timbre in writing for the piano is carried out; they are 'symphonic études' through the wealth and complexity of the colours evoked – the keyboard becomes an ""orchestra"" capable of blending, contrasting or superimposing different timbres.
If etudes Nos. 3 and 9 are excluded, where the connection with the theme is tenuous, the etudes are in variation form. It was not the first time that Schumann had tackled variation form. But here the variation principle is used more as free transformation, no longer of an actual theme, but of a musical 'cell' or cells (as for example in the same composer's Carnaval). The Études symphoniques learn the lesson of Beethoven's Diabelli Variations: the theme that acts as a unifying element is amplified and transformed, and becomes the basis from which blossom inventions of divergent expressive character.  The work also shows the influence of the Goldberg Variations, most obviously in the use of a pseudo-French overture variation, and in the use of various canonic effects.
The highly virtuosic demands of the piano writing are frequently aimed not merely at effect but at clarification of the polyphonic complexity and at delving more deeply into keyboard experimentation. The Etudes are considered to be one of the most difficult works for piano by Schumann (together with his Fantasy in C and Toccata) and in Romantic literature as a whole.


== Later publication history ==
In 1861, five years after Schumann's death, his father-in-law Friedrich Wieck published a third edition under the editorial pseudonym ""DAS"" (an acronym for Der alte Schulmeister).  This edition attempted to reconcile the differences between the earlier two, and bore both the previous titles XII Études Symphoniques and Études en forme de variations.
On republishing the set in 1890, Johannes Brahms restored the five variations that had been cut by Schumann.  These are now often played, but in positions within the cycle that vary somewhat with each performance; there are now twelve variations and these five so-called ""posthumous"" variations which exist as a supplement.
The five posthumously published sections (all based on Fricken's theme) are:

Variation I – Andante, Tempo del tema
Variation II – Meno mosso
Variation III – Allegro
Variation IV – Allegretto
Variation V – Moderato.


== Orchestrations ==
Two sections, including the Allegro brillante,  were orchestrated by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and have been recorded.

56,"NC By Train is a brand name used by the Rail Division of the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) for two state-supported Amtrak routes operating in the U. S. state of North Carolina–the Carolinian and the Piedmont.


== History ==
Amtrak (in full, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) took over most intercity rail service in the United States in 1971. At the outset, service through North Carolina was mostly limited to long-distance routes that were not well-suited for regional travel. This remained unchanged when Southern Railway, one of the larger railroads that initially opted to keep its passenger services, handed its routes to Amtrak in 1979.
By 1984, Amtrak service in North Carolina was limited to four trains: the New Orleans–New York Crescent, which passed through Charlotte and the Piedmont Triad; the New York–Miami Silver Meteor and New York–Savannah Palmetto, which both passed through the Sandhills; and the New York–Miami Silver Star, which passed through Raleigh. The only daylight service came from the Palmetto and northbound Silver Star.
In that year, Governor Jim Hunt created a Public Transportation Division within NCDOT. Partly due to Hunt's efforts, Amtrak introduced the Carolinian on October 28, 1984 as a Charlotte-New York service, supported with a yearly $436,000 state subsidy. It ran from Charlotte through Greensboro and Raleigh along the state-owned North Carolina Railroad, then joined the Palmetto at Richmond, Virginia for the journey to New York.  It was the first direct service between Charlotte and Raleigh in 30 years (or 50 years, depending on the source), and the first North Carolina-focused service in 20 years.
Amtrak intended the Carolinian to be a one-year pilot project, and strongly considered making it a permanent fixture in its schedule. However, due to poor marketing, many passengers did not know that the train offered much of the state a one-seat ride to New York. As a result, while ridership far exceeded projections, the Carolinian lost over $800,000 as most passengers opted to travel within North Carolina and not continue north of the Virginia border. When North Carolina declined to increase its subsidy, Amtrak withdrew the Carolinian on September 3, 1985.Hunt's successor, Jim Martin, was also committed to the development of passenger rail. He created a Passenger Rail Task Force that recommended preserving rail corridors for both freight and passengers. It also recommended additional passenger service along the I-85 Corridor from Charlotte to Raleigh. In 1990, Amtrak and the state introduced a second incarnation of the Carolinian. It ran along the same route as its 1984-85 predecessor, but joined the Palmetto at Rocky Mount. This incarnation was successful enough that within a year, Amtrak not only made the Carolinian permanent, but made it a full-fledged day train running independently from Charlotte to New York.Building on this success, NCDOT formed a Rail Unit, which was expanded to a full-fledged division in 1995. During this time, state officials pressed for additional service along the fast-growing I-85 Corridor. However, Amtrak initially balked, claiming that it didn't have enough rolling stock to spare. NCDOT decided to buy its own equipment. In the fall of 1990, NCDOT bought five repurposed coaches and leased two locomotives for the planned Charlotte-Raleigh service, named the Piedmont, which began service on May 25, 1995. It would have begun service sooner, but Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates the North Carolina Railroad under a longstanding lease with the state, insisted that the state build a wye in Charlotte to turn the trains around. Previously, the southbound Carolinian had to make a time-consuming 10-mile deadhead trip to the nearest wye in Pineville, North Carolina. A second round trip was added in 2010, followed by a third in 2018, with a fourth to come in 2021.


== Marketing and operations ==
Unlike many states that subsidize Amtrak routes within their borders, North Carolina handles much of the marketing and operations for its state-subsidized services itself. It continued to distribute printed timetables for the Carolinian and Piedmont after Amtrak discontinued printed timetables. It operates a toll-free information line, 800-BY-TRAIN, which is staffed by North Carolinians. NCDOT also sets the schedules for the Piedmont and owns the equipment, though it is operated by Amtrak train crews.The NCDOT offers free transit passes which allow detraining Carolinian and Piedmont passengers to get one free bus ride and one transfer on the same day of travel. Passes are honored by 13 participating transit systems along its route.


== Routes ==


=== Carolinian ===

The Carolinian, operating since 1990 and in its current form since 1991, is a 704 mi (1,133 km) route from Charlotte to New York, running once daily in each direction. It serves Charlotte, Kannapolis, Salisbury, High Point, Greensboro, Burlington, Durham, Cary, Raleigh, Selma, Wilson and Rocky Mount before continuing to the Northeast Corridor via Richmond. North Carolina subsidizes the train from Charlotte to the Virginia border.
It is augmented by three Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach routes, two connecting Wilson to large swaths of eastern North Carolina and one connecting Winston-Salem and High Point.
Volunteers from the North Carolina Train Host Association are on hand between Charlotte and Selma to provide information about points of interest in North Carolina. Station hosts are also on hand at the state's three busiest stations–Charlotte, Greensboro and Raleigh. 
The Kannapolis, Salisbury, High Point, Burlington and Selma stations are served by NC Station Attendants who meet all trains and answer travel questions. The other stations along the route are staffed with Amtrak personnel with full ticketing and baggage service.


=== Piedmont ===

The Piedmont, operating since 1995, is a 173 mi (278 km) route from Charlotte to Raleigh with three daily round trips. It travels along the far southern leg of the Carolinian route, largely paralleling Interstate 85. While the Carolinian uses Amtrak rolling stock painted in Amtrak's national red-white-blue scheme, the Piedmont uses state-owned locomotives and coaches painted in a blue-silver-red palette echoing the North Carolina state flag. Its introduction enabled same-day business travel between Charlotte and Raleigh.


== Proposed routes ==


=== Southeast Corridor ===


=== Salisbury – Asheville ===
Western North Carolina had been served by passenger trains following the construction of the Western North Carolina Railroad in the 1850s until the Southern Railway discontinued service in August 1975.In January 1997, NCDOT's Rail Division first studied the possibility of restoring service to the region. Based on projected costs, revenue, and ridership, the best option was determined to be a route between Salisbury and Asheville along 139 miles of Norfolk Southern's S-Line. Intermediate stops would be made in Statesville, Hickory, Morganton, Marion, Old Fort, and Black Mountain. Passenger could transfer to the Piedmont or Carolinian at Salisbury station.In 1999, local stakeholders formed the Western North Carolina Rail Corridor Committee to promote enactment of the route.In March 2001, NCDOT published an updated study with a timetable of phases for the project, along with a cost estimate for each phase. During the first phase, Amtrak would trial the route with Thruway Bus service along US 70 to Asheville. The report also recommended an additional station in Valdese.In April 2002, an NCDOT report proposed a schedule of two daily round trips on the route: one morning and one evening departure in each direction. The report estimated that the station, track, signal, and bridge projects required to start the route would cost $134,700,000.North Carolina's Comprehensive State Rail Plan, last published in August 2015, continues to recommend the rail route and interim Thruway Bus service. The plan estimates a cost of $405,300,000 in 2014 dollars and a ridership of 24,000 in the first year. Noting the age of the original studies, NCDOT prescribes an updated study.In March 2021, Amtrak included the route in its ""Amtrak Connects Us"" 15-year expansion vision ahead of the Biden administration's push to pass the American Jobs Plan.


=== Raleigh – Wilmington ===
In May 2001, NCDOT's Southeastern North Carolina Passenger Rail Feasibility Study showed strong interest in trains from Raleigh to Wilmington. A July 2005 study recommended that two new routes be added to the State Rail Plan. Both routes would start by following the Carolinian and Silver Star corridor from Raleigh to Selma.
The ""Goldsboro route"" would continue southeast from Selma to Goldsboro, then head south to Wilmington with potential stops in Mount Olive, Warsaw, Wallace, Burgaw, and Castle Hayne. This route is the most direct but would require rebuilding 27 miles of track and six rail bridges.
The ""Fayetteville route"" would follow the Palmetto and Silver Meteor corridor southwest from Selma through Fayetteville, then at a new station in Pembroke, branch southeast to Wilmington with potential stops in Lumberton, Bladenboro, Acme/Riegelwood, and Navassa.The 2015 State Rail Plan continues to recommend both routes, listing the estimated cost of the Goldsboro route at $262,500,000 in 2014 dollars and its first-year ridership at 29,000, though the plan also requests new studies to update these figures.In March 2021, Amtrak included the Goldsboro route to Wilmington in its ""Amtrak Connects Us"" 15-year expansion vision.


=== Charlotte – Lynchburg, Virginia ===
Service between Charlotte and Lynchburg, Virginia, is currently provided once daily by the long-distance Crescent. NCDOT is performing a preliminary evaluation for additional service, which may be achieved by extending a Northeast Regional round trip to Charlotte. The cost has been estimated at $35,600,000 in 2014 dollars.


=== Raleigh – Greenville ===
One or more Piedmont round trips could be extended from Raleigh to Greenville along the Carolina Coastal Railway, connecting with the Palmetto and Silver Service at Wilson station.In July 2022, planners from NCDOT and Pitt County announced they would hire a contractor to conduct a feasibility study of the route after receiving a $250,000 federal grant. The study is expected to take 18 months. Supporters of the study include Greenville Mayor P.J. Connelly, East Carolina University Chancellor Philip Rogers, State Representative Brian Farkas, and the head of the Pitt-Greenville Convention & Visitors Authority.


=== Raleigh – Morehead City ===
Service from Raleigh to Morehead City via Selma Union Depot would be possible along existing Norfolk Southern track, with intermediate stops in Goldsboro, Kinston, and New Bern.


=== Raleigh – Hampton Roads, Virginia ===
NCDOT has suggested studying service from Raleigh to Hampton Roads, Virginia's second-largest metropolitan area, home to Virginia Beach and Norfolk. The proposed route would require reconstruction of a disused Raleigh and Gaston Railroad line between Norlina and Roanoke Rapids.

63,"According to the United States Department of Defense, it held more than two hundred Afghan detainees in Guantanamo prior to May 15, 2006. They had been captured and classified as enemy combatants in warfare following the US and allies' invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and disrupt terrorist networks. Originally, the US held such prisoners in sites in Afghanistan, but needed a facility to detain them where they could be interrogated. It opened the Guantanamo Bay detention camp on January 11, 2002, and transported the enemy combatants there.The United States Supreme Court's ruled in Rasul v. Bush (2004) that the detainees had the right of habeas corpus to challenge their detention under the US Constitution. That summer, the Department of Defense stopped transferring detained men to Guantanamo. On September 6, 2006, United States President George W.

Parsons was recruited by Nebraska, Georgia, Oklahoma, Ohio State, Alabama and Penn State. On December 19, it was reported that Ohio State had committed NCAA violations because the university allowed him on the set of ESPN's College GameDay to take a picture with analyst Kirk Herbstreit. Due to the fact that Herbstreit was a former Ohio State University quarterback, it was a violation of NCAA rules as recruits are not allowed to have contact with members of the media associated with former student-athletes. As a result, Ohio State agreed to no longer recruit Parsons.Penn State University offered Parsons a football scholarship after just four games of his freshman season and he initially committed in the spring of 2016, before decommitting for a while and committing again on December 20, 2017. He graduated Harrisburg High School seven months early to expedite the enrollment process.


== College career ==

After committing to Penn State, Parsons was informed by head coach James Franklin that he would start his Penn State career at middle linebacker rather than defensive end, which he played in high school. Franklin also announced that Parsons would be in contention for the starting job even though he was a true freshman. In his freshman year, Parsons only started one out of 13 games for the Nittany Lions, but managed to lead the team in tackles with 82, while also making 4 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks, 10 quarterback hurries and 2 forced fumbles. He became the first Nittany Lion to ever lead the team in tackles as a freshman. He started at outside linebacker against Rutgers University, after junior linebacker Cam Brown was disciplined because of a rules violation incident, with Parsons making 7 tackles (2 for loss) and a strip-sack. He had 14 tackles (one for loss) and a strip-sack against the University of Kentucky in the 2019 Citrus Bowl. He finished second in the Big Ten Freshman of the Year voting behind wide receiver Rondale Moore.
Prior to the start of his sophomore season, Parsons was named to the Butkus Award preseason watch list. He started 12 out of 13 games at middle linebacker, totaling 109 tackles (14 for loss), five sacks, 26 quarterback hurries, five deflected passes, and four forced fumbles. Parsons went on to be named the Butkus–Fitzgerald Linebacker of the Year (given to the Big Ten Linebacker of the Year) and a consensus All-American. Parsons was named the 2019 Cotton Bowl Classic defensive MVP after recording 14 tackles, two sacks, and two forced fumbles.He opted out of the 2020 season due to concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and declined his remaining years of college eligibility in favor of making himself available to the NFL in the 2021 draft.


== Professional career ==


=== 2021 ===
Parsons was selected in the first round (12th overall) by the Dallas Cowboys in the 2021 NFL Draft. He signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $17 million, on June 9, 2021. In response to DeMarcus Lawrence breaking his foot in practice, before week 2, Dallas converted Parsons back to his high school position of defensive end where he saw immediate success, particularly as a pass rusher. In Week 8, Parsons had 11 tackles, including four for loss in a 20-16 win over the Vikings, earning NFC Defensive Player of the Week. From Week 9 to Week 14, Parsons recorded at least 1 sack in six straight games. His 12 sacks in his first 13 career games are the fourth-most by a rookie in NFL history behind only Julius Peppers (13), Reggie White (13) and Leslie O'Neal (12.5). Parsons would finish with 84 total tackles, 13 sacks and three forced fumbles. He was voted into the Pro Bowl, named 1st Team All-Pro by the AP, and was the unanimous Defensive Rookie of the Year.


== Personal life ==
Parsons is a self-taught chess player, who uses the game to cultivate his game on the football field. He played in Chess.com's BlitzChamp tournament, a rapid tournament for NFL players.

66,"Coreopsideae is a tribe of flowering plants belonging to the Asteroideae subfamily. It includes widely cultivated genera such as Cosmos and Dahlia.
A similar group has been recognized since 1829, generally as part of the tribe Heliantheae (Cassini, 1819). In the late 20th century, molecular studies caused a slightly redefined version of this group to be recognized as its own tribe, Coreopsideae. The larger version of Heliantheae was split into tribes including Bahieae, Chaenactideae, Coreopsideae, Helenieae and, finally, Heliantheae (sensu stricto). Within the tribe, the traditional definition of genera based on flower and fruit characters does not reflect evolutionary relationships as inferred through molecular phylogenetics.The tribe is characterized by shiny green bracts at the base of the flower head in two rows: an inner row of tightly spaced bracts and an outer row of a smaller number pointing downward. It includes five genera that use C4 carbon fixation: Chrysanthellum, Eryngiophyllum, Glossocardia (including Guerreroia), Isostigma, and Neuractis. These genera are thought to share a common ancestor and thus a single origin of C4 carbon fixation.

It is built of local redwood and is vaguely Classical in style.
It was deemed significant as ""an excellent example of the style of architecture which was used by the Portuguese when they settled small farming and fishing villages and towns along the California coastline in the latter part of the 19th Century."" It is Capitola's oldest commercial structure and is believed to have been built in 1883.

69,"In mathematics, Chebyshev distance (or Tchebychev distance), maximum metric, or L∞ metric is a metric defined on a vector space where the distance between two vectors is the greatest of their differences along any coordinate dimension. It is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev.
It is also known as chessboard distance, since in the game of chess the minimum number of moves needed by a king to go from one square on a chessboard to another equals the Chebyshev distance between the centers of the squares, if the squares have side length one, as represented in 2-D spatial coordinates with axes aligned to the edges of the board.

  Under this metric, a circle of radius r, which is the set of points with Chebyshev distance r from a center point, is a square whose sides have the length 2r and are parallel to the coordinate axes.
On a chess board, where one is using a discrete Chebyshev distance, rather than a continuous one, the circle of radius r is a square of side lengths 2r, measuring from the centers of squares, and thus each side contains 2r+1 squares; for example, the circle of radius 1 on a chess board is a 3×3 square.


== Properties ==
In one dimension, all Lp metrics are equal – they are just the absolute value of the difference.
The two dimensional Manhattan distance has ""circles"" i.e. level sets in the form of squares, with sides of length √2r, oriented at an angle of π/4 (45°) to the coordinate axes, so the planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to (i.e. a linear transformation of) the planar Manhattan distance.
However, this geometric equivalence between L1 and L∞ metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions. A sphere formed using the Chebyshev distance as a metric is a cube with each face perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, but a sphere formed using Manhattan distance is an octahedron: these are dual polyhedra, but among cubes, only the square (and 1-dimensional line segment) are self-dual polytopes. Nevertheless, it is true that in all finite-dimensional spaces the L1 and L∞ metrics are mathematically dual to each other.
On a grid (such as a chessboard), the points at a Chebyshev distance of 1 of a point are the Moore neighborhood of that point.
The Chebyshev distance is the limiting case of the order-
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   Minkowski distance, when 
  
    
      
        p
      
    
    {\displaystyle p}
   reaches infinity.


== Applications ==
The Chebyshev distance is sometimes used in warehouse logistics, as it effectively measures the time an overhead crane takes to move an object (as the crane can move on the x and y axes at the same time but at the same speed along each axis).
It is also widely used in electronic Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) applications, in particular, in optimization algorithms for these. Many tools, such as plotting or drilling machines, photoplotter, etc. operating in the plane, are usually controlled by two motors in x and y directions, similar to the overhead cranes.

71,"Jan Foss (1 December 1938 - 12 June 2021) was a Norwegian sport shooter from Oslo who became the second world champion in practical shooting in 1976 during the IPSC Handgun World Shoot II in Salzburg, Austria. The favourite ahead of the championship was reigning world champion Ray Chapman from USA, who competed with a 1911-pistol in .45 ACP. Foss took the title with a SIG P210 in 9×19 mm with minor scoring, while Chapman and most of the other competitors shot the .45"" caliber with major scoring which was considered an advantage due to the scoring system. The competition was described as being versatile, and Foss shot 379 points which was enough to take the title with a small margin of only four points ahead of Ray Chapman in second place with 375 points (98.94%). Foss had been unknown before the world championship, and did not compete internationally afterwards. He continued to compete locally throughout his career with pistol, rifle and shotgun where he took several medals.

72,"This is a list of Mesoamerican rulers of the altepetl of Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City) from its foundation in 1325 until the end of the line of indigenous rulers. From c. 1375 onwards, the rulers of Tenochtitlan were monarchs and used the title tlatoani.
From 1427 to 1521, the tlatoque of Tenochtitlan were alongside those of the cities Tetzcoco and Tlacopan the leaders of the powerful Triple Alliance, commonly known as the Aztec Empire. The rulers of Tenochtitlan were always pre-eminent and gradually transitioned into the sole rulers of the empire; under either Tizoc (1481–1486) or Ahuitzotl (1486–1502), the tlatoque of Tenochtitlan assumed the grander title huehuetlatoani (""supreme tlatoani"") to indicate their superiority over the other tlatoque in the alliance. The evolution into full autocracy was finished by 1502, when Moctezuma II was elected as huehuetlatoani of Tenochtitlan without the traditional input from Tetzoco and Tlacopan.In 1521, the Aztec Empire was conquered Spaniards under Hernán Cortés and a large number of Mesoamerican allies. Tenochtitlan was destroyed and replaced by Mexico City, through the Spanish colonial authorities continued to appoint tlatoque of Tenochtitlan until the office was abolished in 1565.


== Early Tenochtitlan (1325–1375) ==


== Monarchic period (1375–1525) ==
The monarchic period of Tenochtitlan extends from the assumption of the title of tlatoani by Acamapichtli in 1377 to the death of Cuauhtémoc in 1525, after the arrival of the Spaniards. The accession of Acampapichtli c. 1375 marks the traditional beginning of the Aztec king list. The early Tenochtitlan rulers before Itzcoatl were vassals under the suzerainty of the Tepanecs.


=== Pre-imperial tlatoque (1375–1427) ===


=== Aztec Empire (1427–1521) ===


== Colonial period (1525–1565) ==
The Spanish colonial authorities continued to appoint tlatoque of Tenochtitlan for several decades after the conquest.


=== Cuauhtlatoque (1525–1536) ===
The initial rulers of Tenochtitlan installed by the Spaniards were not part of the nobility and did not go through the traditional investiture ceremonies. As a result, they were not regarded as legitimate tlatoani by the local populace. Instead, they were titled as cuauhtlatoani, a term that literally meant ""eagle ruler"" and in pre-conquest times served to designate a non-dynastic interim ruler appointed when necessary. Hernán Cortés and the Spaniards initially preferred such less legitimate rulers, possibly as a way of ensuring that the colonial authorities would be able to maintain control.Though the cuauhtlatoque appointed by the Spaniards were not legitimate dynastic rulers, they were noted in later chronicles as governing as if they were tlatoani. Codices made after the time of the cuauhtlatoque differ in how they are treated; some emphasize their illegitimacy as a rupture in the dynastic sequence whereas others do not comment on their lack of relation to previous rulers and instead depict them in the exact same way, as if they were genuine tlatoque.


=== Resumption of dynastic rule (1538–1565) ===
The royal line of tlatoque was restored in 1538. The decision to restore dynastic rule was probably made by the Spanish viceroy Antonio de Mendoza (1535–1550) to preserve the veneer of legitimacy of Spanish rule. Since the Spaniards mainly wished local native rulers to be responsible, pay tribute and be legitimate in the eyes of the people they ruled, the tlatoani were from that point onwards most often appointed after being elected and suggested by the native Nahua nobility.
After 1565, the governors of Tenochtitlan ceased to be appointed under the principle of hereditary succession and ceased to be referred to as tlatoani. This change was partly a result of experiences with Spanish election principles making the denizens of Tenochtitlan view hereditary descent as less important for legitimacy. From the death of Cipac in 1565 until 1688, Tenochtitlan was instead placed under the control of Spanish-appointed governors; these governors continued to be of indigenous or mixed descent and many were descendants of Aztec nobility, though not of the royal dynasty.

73,"Lyrasis is a non-profit member organization serving and supporting libraries, archives, museums, and cultural heritage organizations around the world. Lyrasis is based in the United States. It was created in April 2009 from the merger of SOLINET and PALINET, two US-based library networks.  NELINET, the New England library network, also merged into Lyrasis in late 2009. In January 2011, the Bibliographical Center for Research phased out operations and joined Lyrasis. 


== Overview ==
Lyrasis is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit membership organization whose mission is ""to support enduring access to the world’s shared academic, scientific and cultural heritage through leadership in open technologies, content services,... and collaboration with archives, libraries, museums and knowledge communities worldwide."" Organizational goals include: the development and selection of new technology solutions; fostering community-wide projects that help deliver better outcomes and services; content creation, acquisition and management; support for new content models and strategies; and large-scale knowledge management programs.Lyrasis has more than 1,000 members in 28 countries. Lyrasis is staffed by more than 50 individuals and the company has three main areas of focus: community supported/open source software; technology hosting services; content creation and acquisition. Lyrasis also offers consulting services. Members of Lyrasis include academic, public, special, school, and state libraries, as well as archives and museums.Kate Nevins was the Executive Director of Lyrasis from 2009 until her retirement in 2015. Robert Miller assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer in June 2015.In January 2019 Lyrasis and DuraSpace announced their intention to merge. This is the second time the two organizations have planned a merger.


== Services ==
Community Supported Open Source Software – Lyrasis is the structural and fiscal organizational home to two open source software solutions that have a combined membership of over 350 institutions. This unique model allows for community-driven governance and contribution to work inside the boundaries and security of a professionally managed host organization.
Technology Hosting Services – Lyrasis oversees the hosting and migration services for over 100 institutions from community software platforms. In addition, the software engineers and program managers from Lyrasis contribute code, training and documentation to the community.
Content Creation and Acquisition – Lyrasis is responsible for the negotiation of contracts with over 80 publishers, vendors, and partnering organizations. 
Consulting and Training – Lyrasis has workers who assist members in digitization, preservation, digital preservation, disaster preparedness and strategic planning.
Fiscal Services – Lyrasis assists institutions manage their annual budgets by allowing them to deposit funds for future use, protecting it from unanticipated budget adjustments.
Leader’s Circle, Leaders Forum and Catalyst Fund – More than 200 Lyrasis members are actively involved in these programs so far, engaging in early innovation exploration, cross-institution collaboration and initial vetting of ideas, services and programs. Our members work together on new ideas and trends throughout the year in informal forums. Catalyst Fund ideas submitted by members are then selected by vote of the Leaders Circle to be funded. During the annual Member Summit, Catalyst Fund recipients report on progress and members work together to consider future directions for funded projects, including expansion and potential grant or business planning.
Investments – Lyrasis works with members to submit and receive grants from foundations such as The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to support ideas and programs on behalf of its members and other libraries, archives and museums who need access to these innovative programs. Furthermore, Lyrasis has reinvested proceeds from its traditional investments into potential ideas, program and solutions to benefit its membership.Research and an Inclusive Approach to Open Access  - In  2020,  Lyrasis  Research  conducted  a  member  survey  of  predominantly  U.S. higher education libraries to understand the spectrum of attitudes and actions related to Open Access. The results indicated that  the  U.S.  approach  to  OA  is  decentralised,  lacking  the  focused  trends  that  are  apparent  in  other  areas  of  the  world. Only a quarter of institutions are paying for OA on behalf of 60% of students, demonstrating a major imbalance in support of OA programs. In 2021  43%  of  all  U.S.  higher  education  institutions  at  the  doc-toral  level  are  participating  in  OA  programs  through  Lyrasis.


== Open source ==
Since 2013 Lyrasis has supported a number of open source software efforts. Lyrasis serves as the organizational home for a number of open source communities including ArchivesSpace, CollectionSpace, Fedora, ORCiD, and Vivo. Additionally, Lyrasis provides hosting services, technical and user support, and code contributions for ArchivesSpace, CollectionSpace, DSpaceDirect, DuraCloud, Islandora and the Palace Project.

74,"Neuenbürg is a town in the Enz district, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is situated on the river Enz, 10 km southwest of Pforzheim.


== History ==
Neuenbürg originated as a village around a castle built by the House of Vaihingen in the 12th century. Between 1315 and 1322, Neuenbürg became a possession of the Counts of Württemberg, who gave it town rights. With the villages of Arnbach, Dennach, and Waldrennach, Neuenbürg was assigned its own district. On 18 March 1806, that district was reorganized as Oberamt Neuenbürg. The Oberamt was dissolved on 1 October 1938 and its constituents were assigned to the Calw district. When the Enz district was created by the 1973 Baden-Württemberg district reform on 1 January 1973, Neuenbürg and its villages were assigned to it. Arnbach, Dennach, and Waldrennach were fully incorporated into Neuenbürg on 1 January 1975.


== Geography ==
The township (Stadt) of Neuenbürg covers 28.17 square kilometers (10.88 sq mi) of the Enz district, within the state of Baden-Württemberg and the Federal Republic of Germany. It is physically located on the Pfinzhügelland, on the southern reaches of the Kraichgau. The geological makeup of the municipal area is decided by the meeting of the Pfinzhügelland's muschelkalk and keuper and the Black Forest's buntsandstein plateaus. The main watercourse is the Enz, which flows in a deep bed of Middle Buntsandstein. Where the Enz flows into Birkenfeld marks the lowest elevation above sea level in the municipal area, 309 meters (1,014 ft) Normalnull (NN). The highest is the top of the Heuberg, south of Dennach, at 709 meters (2,326 ft) NN.A portion of the Eyach and Rotenbach Valley Federally-protected nature reserve is found within Neuenbürg's municipal area.


== Coat of arms ==
Neuenbürg's municipal coat of arms depicts a red, hexagonal tower upon a field of white. The oldest images to be associated with the township are from 1440, as an engraving, and in 1490, from a print. The first coat of arms associated with Neuenbürg is from 1535, and showed the tower in red but the field as being blue. The change to a white field was made in 1956 by agreement of the municipal government and the Central State Archive Stuttgart. This pattern was then approved by the Federal Ministry of the Interior on 18 February 1958.


== Transport ==
The town has three stops, Neuenbürg, Neuenbürg Süd and Neuenbürg Freibad, on route S6 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn, which operates over the Enztalbahn railway.

76,"In Chinese philosophy, a taijitu (simplified Chinese: 太极图; traditional Chinese: 太極圖; pinyin: tàijítú; Wade–Giles: t'ai⁴chi²t'u²)  is a symbol or diagram (图; tú) representing Taiji (太极; tàijí; 'utmost extreme') in both its monist (wuji) and its dualist (yin and yang) aspects. Such a diagram was first introduced by Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhou Dunyi (周敦頤; 1017–1073) of the Song Dynasty in his Taijitu shuo (太極圖說).
The modern Taoist canon, compiled during the Ming era, has at least half a dozen variants of such taijitu. The two most similar are the ""Taiji Primal Heaven"" (太極先天圖; tàijí xiāntiān tú) and the ""wuji"" (無極圖; wújí tú) diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's taijitu.Ming period author Lai Zhide (1525–1604) simplified the taijitu to a design of two interlocking spirals. In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the taijitu with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the He tu or ""Yellow River diagram"" (河圖). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the ""Great Monad"", and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the ""yin-yang symbol"" since the 1960s. The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is 太极兩儀图 ""two-part Taiji diagram"".
Ornamental patterns with visual similarity to the ""yin-yang symbol"" are found in archaeological artefacts of European prehistory; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed ""yin yang symbols"" in archaeological literature by modern scholars.


== Structure ==
The taijitu consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the ""yin and yang symbol"", itself popularly called taijitu, represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.

At the top, an empty circle depicts the absolute (Wuji)
A second circle represents the Taiji as harboring Dualism, yin and yang, represented by filling the circle in a black-and-white pattern. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.
Below this second circle is a five-part diagram representing the Five Agents (Wuxing), representing a further stage in the differentiation of Unity into Multiplicity. The Five Agents are connected by lines indicating their proper sequence,  Wood (木) → Fire (火) → Earth (土) → Metal (金) → Water (水).
The circle below the Five Agents represents the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, which in turn gives rise to the ""ten thousand things"". This stage is also represented by the Eight Trigrams (Bagua).
The final circle represents the state of multiplicity, glossed  ""The ten thousand things are born by transformation"" (萬物化生; modern 化生万物)


== History ==

The term taijitu in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple ""divided circle"" form (), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of symmetry representing yin and yang.


=== Song and Yuan eras ===

While the concept of yin and yang dates to Chinese antiquity, the interest in ""diagrams"" (圖 tú) is an intellectual fashion of Neo-Confucianism during the Song period (11th century), and it declined again in the Ming period, by the 16th century. During the Mongol Empire and Yuan dynasty, Taoist traditions and diagrams were compiled and published in the encyclopedia Shilin Guangji by Chen Yuanjing.The original description of a taijitu is due to Song era philosopher Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073), author of the Taijitu shuo 太極圖說 ""Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate"", which became the cornerstone of Neo-Confucianist cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism with metaphysical discussions in the Yijing.
Zhou's key terms Wuji and Taiji appear in the opening line 無極而太極, which Adler notes could also be translated ""The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar"".

Non-polar (wuji) and yet Supreme Polarity (taiji)! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates yang; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates yin; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing yin and yang, the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of yang and yin generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] qi harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply yin and yang; yin and yang are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.
Instead of usual Taiji translations ""Supreme Ultimate"" or ""Supreme Pole"", Adler uses ""Supreme Polarity"" (see Robinet 1990) because Zhu Xi describes it as the alternating principle of yin and yang, and ...

insists that taiji is not a thing (hence ""Supreme Pole"" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, taiji is the yin-yang principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic ""first principle."" Wuji as ""non-polar"" follows from this. 
Since the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi's diagram.
Zhu Xi (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources. Zhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of dao.


=== Ming and Qing eras ===

While Zhou Dunyi (1017–1073) popularized the circular diagram, the introduction of ""swirling"" patterns first appears in the Ming period.
Zhao Huiqian (趙撝謙, 1351–1395) was the first to introduce the ""swirling"" variant of the taijitu in his Liushu benyi (六書本義, 1370s). The diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (bagua) and called the ""River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth"".
By the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of Chinese cosmology.The dots were introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the Qing period. The dots represent the seed of yin within yang and the seed of yang within yin; the idea that neither can exist without the other.
Lai Zhide's design is similar to the gakyil (dga' 'khyil or ""wheel of joy"") symbols of Tibetan Buddhism; but while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the Three Jewels or the Four Noble Truths, i.e. as a triskele and a tetraskelion design), Lai Zhide's taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.


== Modern yin-yang symbol ==
The Ming-era design of the taijitu of two interlocking spirals was a common yin-yang symbol in the first half of the 20th century. The flag of South Korea, originally introduced as the flag of Joseon era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the Bat Quai Do used as the Joseon royal standard.
Since the 1960s, the He tu symbol, which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots, has more commonly been used as a yin-yang symbol.
compare  with 
In the standard form of the contemporary symbol, one draws on the diameter of a circle two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the radius of the outer circle. One keeps the line that forms an ""S"", and one erases or obscures the other line. The design is also described as a ""pair of fishes nestling head to tail against each other"".The Soyombo symbol of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.
It combines several abstract shapes, including a Taiji symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.The modern  symbol has  also been widely used in martial arts, particularly t'ai chi ch'uan (Taijiquan), and Jeet Kune Do, since the 1970s.
In this context, it is generally used to represent the interplay between hard and soft techniques.
The dots in the modern ""yin-yang symbol"" have been given the additional interpretation of ""intense interaction"" between the complementary principles, i.e. a flux or flow to achieve harmony and balance.

		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		


== Similar symbols ==

Similarities can be seen in Neolithic–Eneolithic era Cucuteni–Trypillia culture on the territory of current Ukraine and Romania. Patterns containing ornament looking like Taijitu from archeological artifacts of that culture were displayed in the Ukraine pavilion at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China.The interlocking design is found in artifacts of the European Iron Age. Similar interlocking designs are found in the Americas: Xicalcoliuhqui.
While this design appears to become a standard ornamental motif in Iron-Age Celtic culture by the 3rd century BC, found on a wide variety of artifacts, it is not clear what symbolic value was attached to it. Unlike the Chinese symbol, the Celtic yin-yang lack the element of mutual penetration, and the two halves are not always portrayed in different colors. Comparable designs are also found in Etruscan art.

89,"Boxing Legends of the Ring is a boxing video game for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Super NES consoles. The boxers are represented by 2D sprites seen from over the shoulder of one of the fighters. The title of the game refers to the famous boxing magazine, The Ring, which the game is licensed to associate itself with. The following famous middleweight boxers are represented in the game: Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Durán, Thomas Hearns, James Toney, Marvin Hagler, Jake LaMotta, Sugar Ray Robinson, and Rocky Graziano.All of the fights in the game take place in the Las Vegas Hilton casino in the North American version. There are also advertising banners for HBO visible during fights that are not available in the Japanese version. In the Japanese version, the game takes place in a generic boxing ring using the publisher's name in place of the HBO advertisements found in the North American version.
A special version was released in Mexico and the American Southwest called Chavez II; the game exchanged the English language words for Spanish and omitted some vocals.


== Gameplay ==

During fights, it is possible to keep track of the participating boxers' wellbeing by observing the small portraits of the fighters' faces at the top of the screen. As the fighters receive punishment, these portraits show injuries such as cuts and bruises, the severity of which indicate the fighter's health (or lack of). There is also a boxing glove shaped meter at the top of the screen, that indicates how much power a boxer has left in his punches (as in a real fight, the more punches boxers throw, the more tired they become, resulting in weaker punches).
The fighters' movement about the ring is limited to side-stepping left or right; it is impossible to step back or forward. A variety of punches can be thrown; left jabs, crosses to the head, hooks to the body, and uppercuts to the head (all punches except jabs can be thrown with either hand). It is also possible to throw a limited number of so-called 'super punches', that are essentially either a right cross or a right uppercut, but with extra power. At the start of each round, each boxer is capable of throwing one super-punch at any time, although it becomes possible to throw one more with each knockdown they score against their opponent. Defensive techniques consist of blocking, dodging, and clinching. Each boxer has three attributes: 'power', 'stamina', and 'chin'.

There are three different modes: 'exhibition', 'career', and 'battle of the legends'. In 'exhibition' mode, a player can choose to fight as any boxer in the game, against any boxer in the game, against either the console or another player. In 'career' mode, a player creates their own boxer, and fights their way through all the boxers in the game, before fighting for the world title. If the player loses once in 'career' mode, he is given a warning that 'game over' would be given for the second loss; giving the player no alternative but to either use a password or start over again with a new boxer.


== Presentation ==
Each fight is seen from behind and slightly to one side of one of the boxers, so that the player appears to be looking over their shoulder, in the direction of their opponent. In the North American version, the blood is colored red while the Japanese version uses sweat instead. This is contrary to Nintendo's then-current censorship policy that blood should never be used in their games. Between each round, girls in bikinis announce the next round by showing a number around the ring (and to the player).


== Reception ==

Reviewing the SNES release as Chavez II, GamePro assessed that while it was not one of the best boxing games for the system, it was a surprisingly strong improvement from the original, with faster controls and sharper, bloodier graphics. They summarized it as ""decent"".Next Generation stated that ""other than the novely of Spanish text and Chavez on the box, you're just as well off picking up [...] Legends of the Ring."" Super Gamer magazine gave the SNES version a review score of 81% stating: ""Huge character graphics get you right into the bone-crunching action. Gameplay is somewhat limited, but there is always plenty of challenge and moves.""

95,"Railway electric traction describes the various types of locomotive and multiple units that are used on electrification systems around the world.


== History ==
Railway electrification as a means of traction emerged at the end of the nineteenth century, although experiments in electric rail have been traced back to the mid-nineteenth century. Thomas Davenport, in Brandon, Vermont, erected a circular model railroad on which ran battery-powered locomotives (or locomotives running on battery-powered rails) in 1834. Robert Davidson, of Aberdeen, Scotland, created an electric locomotive in 1839 and ran it on the Edinburgh-Glasgow railway at 4 miles per hour. The earliest electric locomotives tended to be battery-powered. In 1880, Thomas Edison built a small electrical railway, using a dynamo as the motor and the rails as the current-carrying medium. The electric current flowed through the metal rim of otherwise wooden wheels, being picked up via contact brushes.Electrical traction offered several benefits over the then predominant steam traction, particularly in respect of its quick acceleration (ideal for urban (metro) and suburban (commuter) services) and power (ideal for heavy freight trains through mountainous/hilly sections). A plethora of systems emerged in the first twenty years of the twentieth century.


== Unit types ==


=== DC traction units ===
Direct current (DC) traction units use current drawn from a third rail, fourth rail, ground-level power supply or an overhead line. AC voltage is converted into DC voltage by using a rectifier.


=== AC traction units ===
Alternating current (AC) Traction units involve an Inverter and produce variable traction output based on the frequency of the AC current. They are equipped in most modern rolling stock for lower maintenance cost and easier scalability relative to DC units.


=== Multi-system units ===

Because of the variety of railway electrification systems, which can vary even within a country, trains often have to pass from one system to another. One way to accomplish this is by changing locomotives at the switching stations. These stations have overhead wires that can be switched from one voltage to another and so the train arrives with one locomotive and then departs with another. The switching stations have very sophisticated components and they are very expensive.
A less expensive switching station may have different electrification systems at both exits with no switchable wires. Instead the voltage on the wires changes across a small gap in them near the middle of the station. Electric locomotives coast into the station with their pantographs down and halt under a wire of the wrong voltage. A diesel shunter can then return the locomotive to the right side of the station. Both approaches are inconvenient and time-consuming, taking about ten minutes.
Another way is to use multi-system motive power that can operate under several different voltages and current types. In Europe, two-, three and four-system locomotives for cross frontier freight traffic are becoming a common sight (1.5 kV DC, 3 kV DC, 15 kV  16.7 Hz AC, 25 kV, 50 Hz AC).  Locomotives and multiple units so equipped can, depending on line configuration and operation rules, pass from one electrification system to another without a stop, coasting for a short distance for the change over, past the dead section between the different voltages.
Eurostar trains through the Channel Tunnel are multisystem; a significant part of the route near London was on southern England's 750 V DC third rail system, the route into Brussels is 3,000 V DC overhead, while the rest of the route is 25 kV 50 Hz overhead.  The need for these trains to use third rail into London Waterloo station ended upon completion of High Speed 1 line in 2007. Southern England uses some overhead/third rail dual-system locomotives, such as the class 92 for Channel Tunnel, and multiple units, e.g. the Class 319 on Thameslink services,  to allow through running between 750 V DC third rail south of London and 25 kV AC overhead north and east of London.
Electro-diesel locomotives which can operate as an electric locomotive on electrified lines but have an on-board diesel engine for non-electrified sections or sidings have been used in several countries; examples are the British Class 73 from the 1960s and the last mile concept from around 2011, where an electric freight locomotive can work sidings under Diesel power (TRAX dual mode).


== Battery electric rail vehicles ==
A few battery electric railcars and locomotives were used in the twentieth century, but generally the use of battery power was not practical except in underground mining systems. See Accumulator car and Battery locomotive.


== High-speed rail ==
Many high-speed rail systems use electric trains, such as the Shinkansen and the TGV.

97,"The foreign relations of Norway are based on the country's membership in NATO and within the workings of the United Nations (UN). Additionally, despite not being a member of the European Union (EU), Norway takes a part in the integration of EU through its membership in the European Economic Area. Norway's foreign ministry includes both the minister of foreign affairs and minister of international development.


== History ==

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established on the same day that Norway declared the dissolution of the union with Sweden: June 7, 1905. Although diplomats could not present credentials to foreign governments until the Swedish king formally renounced his right to the Norwegian throne, a number of unofficial representatives worked on the provisional government's behalf until the first Norwegian ambassador, Hjalmar Christian Hauge, sought accreditation by the United States Secretary of State Elihu Root on November 6, 1905.
The initial purposes of the newly formed Foreign Ministry were to represent Norway's interests through diplomatic channels, and to provide consular services for Norwegian shipping and commerce overseas. In 1906, the Storting decided to establish six embassies in Europe, with two more in the Americas: one in the United States and one in Argentina. 20 consular offices were also opened.
During World War I, the foreign ministry was confronted with unprecedented challenges in maintaining neutrality for Norway, in particular in order to protect its merchant fleet.
In 1922, the ministry was consolidated and reorganised to ensure fuller cooperation between the diplomatic and consular branches. The reorganization included the formation of a designated career path for diplomats that included completion of a university entrance examination and professional experience from international trade. The economic hardship of the times forced austerity measures at the ministry for the next several years.
When Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, the government fled to the United Kingdom and reconstituted in exile in Bracknell, outside London. Kingston House in London was later used. The government moved back to Norway following the peace in 1945.
After the end of World War II, Norway was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and the United Nations, the latter having Norwegian Trygve Lie as inaugural Secretary-General. Norway was also part of the first slate of non-permanent members to the United Nations Security Council.


== Elements of policy ==
Since the end of the Cold War, Norway has developed a model to foreign policy known as the ""Norwegian model,"" the goal of which is to contribute to peace and stability through coordinated response among governmental and non-governmental Norwegian organizations; acting as an honest broker in international conflicts; an informal network of Norwegian individuals with access and credibility among parties; and the willingness to take the long view in international issues.
The post-war foreign policy of Norway can be described along four dimensions:


=== Strategic alliances ===
Norway's strategic importance for waging war in the North Atlantic became important in the failed neutrality policy of World War II.  Norway became a founding member of NATO in order to ally itself with countries that shared its democratic values.  Both through diplomatic and military cooperation, Norway has played a visible role in the formation and operations of NATO.  It allowed a limited number of military bases and exercises to be based in its territories, which caused some controversy when NATO decided to put forward bases in Northern Norway in preparation for a conflict with the Soviet Union.


=== International cooperation ===
Norway supports international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of disputes, recognizing the need for maintaining a strong national defence through collective security. Accordingly, the cornerstones of Norwegian policy are active membership in NATO and support for the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Norway also pursues a policy of economic, social, and cultural cooperation with other Nordic countries—Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Iceland—through the Nordic Council. Its relations with Iceland are very close due to the cultural bond the two nations share. Norway ended a 2-year term on the UN Security Council in January 2003, and chaired the Iraq Sanctions Committee.
Norway, along with Iceland the Farore Islands, is not a member of the European Union, all three are members of the European Economic Area. Membership of the EU has been proposed within Norway, and referendums over Norwegian membership were held in 1972 and 1994. Popular opinion was split between rural and urban areas. See Norway and the European Union.
The present government is not planning to raise the possibility for future membership.
Norway also has a history of co-operation and friendship with the United Kingdom and Scotland, due to their shared cultural heritage since Viking times. The Vikings conquered areas including the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland for several hundred years. Norway is only 300 kilometres (159 Nautical miles) east of Unst, the northernmost island of Shetland.  The Norwegian embassy to the United Kingdom is located in London, and Norway also maintains a Consulate General in Edinburgh. A Norway Spruce is given by the city of Oslo and presented to London as a Christmas tree for display in Trafalgar Square as a token of gratitude for the UK's support during World War II.  King Haakon, his son Crown Prince Olav and the country's government lived in exile in London throughout the war. As part of the tradition, the Lord Mayor of Westminster visits Oslo in the late autumn to take part in the felling of the tree, and the Mayor of Oslo then goes to London to light the tree at the Christmas ceremony.
On 25 April 2022, Norwegian foreign minister visited Bangladesh as part of her two day trip in order to broadening economic partnership through trade, investment and maritime sector cooperation.


=== International mediation and nation building ===
Norway has played an active role as a third party mediator in a number of international conflicts.  The late foreign minister Johan Jørgen Holst was instrumental in forging the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO.  Thorvald Stoltenberg was part of the unsuccessful mediation team in seeking an end to the war in Bosnia.  Norway has contributed both mediation services and financial assistance in Guatemala.
As of 2005, Norwegian diplomats are acting as mediators in Sudan, Bosnia, Sri Lanka, and Colombia. Some of those countries accuse Norway of supporting and propping up separatist groups.  Israel is often bitter with harsh criticisms from Norwegian politicians. The spat was at its highest when finance minister Kristin Halvorsen supported boycott of Israeli goods. in early 2006. Finance ministry spokesman, Runar Malkenes, told BBC News that ""there are no moves to push for a boycott of Israeli goods"" at government level. Eritrea has been actively supported by Norway during its liberation from Ethiopia. As of recent, Ethiopia expelled six Norwegian diplomats due to Norway's alleged support to 'Terrorist group and Eritrea'. Norway retaliated by cutting aid to Ethiopia.
After the Al-Qaeda attack on the United States on September 11, 2001, NATO launched a military invasion to overthrow Al-Qaeda and its Taliban sponsors. Norway was one of 51 donors providing aid and assistance to rebuild the war-torn country. Norway had charge of Faryab Province. The Norwegian-led Provincial Reconstruction Team had the mission of effecting security, good governance and economic development, 2005–2012. But the results were dubious and frustration continued until the U.S. and all other countries finally decided to withdraw by 2021.


=== International disputes ===
Territorial claims in Antarctica (Queen Maud Land and Peter I Island) are only recognized by Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.


=== Status-seeking ===
A number of scholars have argued that Norway has through its foreign policy engaged in status-seeking. Through an activist foreign policy, Norway has sought to elevate its standing among the international system's small powers and middle powers, and earn recognition from the great powers.

The road runs from an intersection with SR 789 in Bradenton Beach east to U.S. Route 41 (US 41) and unsigned SR 55 in South Bradenton. SR 684 is known as Cortez Road its entire length and varies from a two-lane road between Bradenton Beach and Cortez to a four- to six-lane road east of Cortez. The easternmost portion of SR 684 is concurrent with US 41 and is unsigned.


== Route description ==
SR 684 begins at an intersection with SR 789 on the Gulf of Mexico in Bradenton Beach, heading east on two-lane undivided Cortez Road West. The road passes resort development before crossing Sarasota Pass on a drawbridge. At this point, the state road heads into Cortez and gains a center left-turn lane, passing residential development. SR 684 curves southeast and becomes a four-lane divided highway, passing through wooded areas with some trailer parks to the south, with the median turning into a center left-turn lane. The road heads to the east again and continues through residential areas. The state road gains a median again and continues between homes and businesses to the north and fields to the south. SR 684 heads into Bradenton and heads east through residential and commercial development as a four-lane divided highway. The road widens to six lanes as it continues through business areas and comes to an intersection with US 41/US 41 Bus./SR 45 in South Bradenton. At this intersection, US 41 heads south on unsigned SR 45 while US 41 Bus. heads north on unsigned SR 45. It is here that SR 684 signage ends and that US 41 turns east to form a concurrency with the unsigned SR 684, with US 41/SR 684 continuing east on Cortez Road West. The road passes through more commercial areas, heading to the south of the DeSoto Square shopping mall. After passing the mall, US 41 curves north to follow unsigned SR 55 on 1st Street, while SR 684 briefly follows 44th Street East eastbound and 44th Street Connector westbound before ending. The road continues east as locally-maintained 44th Avenue East.

However, in 2009, it stopped emitting pulses completely.
Most pulsars that stop emitting pulses only do so for a few minutes. But PSR J1841-0500 did so for 580 days. Then in August 2011, it started pulsing again. In comparison, only one other pulsar is known to stop pulsing for more than a few minutes: PSR B1931+24 turns on for a week and then stops emitting pulses for a month in a cycle.
